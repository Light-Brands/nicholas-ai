# August 2025: Ibogaine Booster Doses

## Understanding the Boosters

After the flood dose, the protocol included four booster doses over the following days.

While the flood dose was the earthquake—breaking, drilling, rewiring—the boosters served different purposes:

- Cleansing what was exposed
- Anchoring what was revealed
- Deepening the integration
- Sealing the transformation

Each booster brought unique revelations and challenges.

## Booster Dose #1: The Cleansing

**Theme: Restoration of Memory and Sleep**

The first booster was gentle compared to the flood.

It felt like waves of water washing through me—cleansing the debris left behind from the drilling and rewiring.

One truth kept coming:

*God is using Ibogaine to restore my memory and repair my sleep.*

This phrase repeated again and again, filling me with peace.

God was not only healing me spiritually but restoring my mind and body.

### The Ambassador Calling

During this booster, I sensed a deeper alignment with my future divine mandate.

A clear call emerged: to become an **ambassador of God's creation**.

To share the truth that our Creator has already provided everything we need for healing—even through plants, roots, and molecules like Ibogaine.

I saw how many Christians, though faithful in prayer, are still tormented by anxiety, depression, and trauma.

This ambassadorship is a call to share that healing is truly possible—and that God sometimes uses different pathways to bring wholeness.

I also felt called to be an ambassador within **AA and NA**—to share with those who have years of abstinence but still confess, *"I am fighting my demons."*

So many remain bound by depression, insomnia, anxiety, and trauma.

God can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves.

## Booster Dose #2: The Vision

**Theme: Protection, Purpose, and Integrity**

The second booster shifted settings—from the medical room to my personal room.

As the clouds and tapestry of heaven stretched before me through the window, awe filled my soul.

### Pepe: The Guardian

The first vision was of **Pepe**, my childhood dog.

My memories of him are faint, but I was always told how protective he was—always guarding me, never letting harm near.

In seeing him, God reminded me:

*I have always been protected. Even in the earliest years, when you were most vulnerable, My shield was around you.*

### Purpose-Driven Work

God showed me clarity around purpose-driven work and business development.

It is not wrong to build businesses and organizations—as long as they remain in alignment with God's desires and divine order.

The correction was this: in the past, I moved in excitement and reactivity, investing time, energy, and money without proper agreements and structure.

That disorder bred stress.

Now I know: **Order first—then expansion.**

### Integrity of My Word

God brought conviction around integrity with my word.

My word is my bond—greater than any signed contract.

Too often in the past, I gave my word and failed to complete it.

That season is finished.

From this moment forward, I walk in completion, integrity, and truth.

### The Sacred Ibogaine Treatment Center

Another powerful download came: the vision of establishing a **Sacred Ibogaine Treatment Center**—whether in Mexico or Costa Rica.

My story is not for me alone—it is to be shared with the world.

My trials are now my triumphs.

My mess is my message.

My test is my testimony.

## Booster Dose #3: The Battle

**Theme: Victory Over the Enemy**

The third booster was the most intense.

It brought me face-to-face with the devil himself.

For years, he had tried to imprison my mind with shame, fear, and guilt—beating me down and attempting to steal my destiny.

But in this sacred moment, I stood from a new position:

**I have died with Christ. I am washed in His blood. I am resurrected in His power. I am the son of the Great I AM.**

For the first time, I looked at the enemy not as a victim but as a **victor**.

I spoke with authority:

*"You tried. You tried to take me out so many times because you knew I was chosen, because you knew my pain would become purpose. But you failed. My mind is now guarded by the Holy Spirit, sealed by the blood of Jesus, and I have the mind of Christ. It is finished. I am free."*

For nearly fifteen minutes, I stood in dominion, kicking back the darkness, proclaiming the truth.

### Technology and Addiction

God also revealed how deeply addicted I had been to my phone—not just the device, but the false sense of control and distraction it offers.

Social media and endless scrolling are hypnotizers designed to drain life from the mind, soul, and presence of God.

I now claim dominion over technology: it will not control me.

I will use it with presence, intention, and discipline—for knowledge, creation, and Kingdom purpose.

### My Wife

The third revelation was about Nancy.

I saw how much she has carried—how she has borne the weight of keeping our kingdom from collapsing while I battled through years of darkness.

Now it must be her time.

Our healing must be walked together.

I felt the deep call to approach her with humility, grace, peace, and authentic communication.

My actions, not just my words, must speak.

## Booster Dose #4: The Stillness

**Theme: Discernment and Family**

The fourth booster unfolded in deep calm and serenity—unlike the intensity of earlier ceremonies.

In the stillness, I received clear conviction:

I must walk with vigilance and discernment, being careful not to open myself to spirits, energies, or portals that masquerade as light but are not aligned with the truth of God.

What matters is fidelity to the **Trinitarian God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.**

### Christ as the Model

Jesus revealed Himself again as the ultimate example—the rebel of all rebels, the savage of savages.

His way of living flowed not from performance, but from **being**.

His identity, purpose, and truth were rooted in perfect union with the Father.

He acted only in obedience to what He saw and heard from God.

This is the pattern for my own life: to trust, surrender, and obey with childlike faith and radical dependence.

### Family Centrality

A second revelation shone through: the centrality of family.

My Queen needs me—not through words, persuasion, or pressure, but through the testimony of my behavior.

It is my **presence, tenderness, and intentional attention to small details** that will inspire her toward her own healing journey.

Grace and action—not talk—will be the fruits of my transformation.

## Integration Summary

The four boosters sealed two truths:

1. **Guard the Gates** — Stay rooted in God's Word, discerning and rejecting all that masquerades as light but is not of Father, Son, and Spirit.

2. **Lead by Fruits** — In family and love, it is not my speech but my actions, my tenderness, my consistency, and my presence that will testify to the reality of God in me.

The closing declaration resounded:

**"It is finished. And now it begins."**
