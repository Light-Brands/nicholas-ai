# 1996-2001: Departure and New York

## Anger, Identity Collapse, and the Second Covenant (Age 15-16)

Around the time of my first heartbreak, someone went to the car dealership where my Dad worked. He asked the receptionist to speak to Jeff Courchesne. When my Dad showed up, he saw a teenage boy standing beside the reception desk.

My Dad said to him, "Hello, how may I help you?"

The young boy replied, "Hello, Dad."

Before giving his life to Jesus, my Dad had been living a double life. He had been completely truthful with my mother about his affairs and the possibility that he may have other children. My mother forgave him wholeheartedly and never brought the subject back.

She explained, "Who am I not to forgive? I have been completely forgiven by Jesus, and my responsibility is to extend that forgiveness toward my husband and love toward that young boy."

My Dad and my half-brother tried to connect at that time, but it was not meant to be. Something always seemed to come up that pushed back the possibility of connection until they eventually lost contact.

When I learned about my half-brother and my Dad's affair, I became extremely angry. It fueled resentment, anxiety, and suffering to a whole new level.

I started questioning how my pain and hurt could make me shift internally so rapidly, forgetting all of my values, mindset, and beliefs.

Was the suppression of my dreams and visions, combined with suffering and confusion, the beginning of a fast downhill spiral toward worldly sedation and darkness?

It was.

## Becoming My Own God

I remember telling myself, "If this is God, then I will be my own god."

Wrong choices followed wrong choices to numb the pain. I started hanging out with the wrong crowd. I experienced many drugs mixed with alcohol. Partying like rock stars became normal. I had sex with many young girls and treated them with no respect, despite their emotions.

The entrepreneur in me quickly connected the dots, and without hesitation, I became a drug dealer.

My parents were being called to school weekly because of my behavior. Stealing, fighting, hurting people, having people overdose and potentially die because of the drugs we were selling—this became part of the lifestyle surrounding my rise toward becoming the king of the jungle.

## Expulsion and Criminal Record

During my fourth year of high school, we participated in an exchange trip with another school in Costa Rica. The goal was to study their culture and learn Spanish.

It took less than a week for the teachers to realize that I was influencing other students to escape the houses we were living in to go clubbing and get high on drugs and alcohol.

They made the decision to send me back home one week before the end of the trip.

My parents picked me up from the airport in Montreal. Not one word was spoken during the two-hour drive back home to Gatineau.

When I entered the house, there was one pound of marijuana waiting for me on the kitchen table.

I was in shock. How could they have found it? It was so well hidden.

My parents looked at me with despair. Sadness, hurt, and pain embodied their entire being.

---

## The Ultimatum and the Second Covenant

The next day, my Dad sat me down and said:

"Son, I love you, but you have two choices. You need to change your lifestyle and live under the values of this house, or you can continue in your ways, but you will have to leave our home."

I went into my room, packed my bags, walked back through the kitchen, and stopped between the two exit doors.

I turned around and looked at my Dad. He was standing by the counter, devastated. Love, anger, sadness, and pain were written all over his face.

Looking straight into his eyes, I said:

"One day you will hear about Nicholas Courchesne. I will succeed no matter what. Watch me."

I turned around and left home, just like the prodigal son.

That day, I made a second covenant with myself.

I was going to become famous, rich, successful, and important. I was going to prove to my Dad—for all the wrong reasons—that even if I disobeyed and dishonored him, I was going to make it big.

Whatever needed to be done to reach the summit of worldly, illusional success, I was ready to do it.

## Police Pressure and Criminal Record

Much tension started happening with the school and the police. They knew about my business and were preparing to catch me in action. My grades started to go downhill, and because of the situation that happened in Costa Rica, the direction of the school made the decision to expel me from the international program.

I finished my last year of high school in the general program instead and did not graduate with honors from the international program.

The police busted me at school, but by grace, on that day I had no drugs on me.

A small voice inside of me kept telling me to walk away from the drug business—that my days were numbered and that prison would become my next home if I didn't make a drastic decision.

I woke up the next morning and made the ultimate decision. I was done. I liquidated everything I had and never looked back.

The police were not happy, but they had their fair share when I got caught one day stealing rims from a car in the parking lot of a mall. They didn't miss the opportunity to charge me with theft and falsely charge me with resisting arrest and being violent.

The judge had no mercy. I was convicted of three felonies and had to face the consequences of being labeled with a criminal record at the age of sixteen years old.

## Meeting Nancy

During that time, I had very unhealthy relationships with girls my age and even with a woman who was ten years older than me. She opened the world of sexual immorality to me at a whole new level.

Because of the covenant I had made with myself, as soon as I started feeling any type of emotion toward someone, I would do everything in my power to destroy the relationship.

In the middle of this dark episode, I met an angel. Her name was Nancy. She was beautiful inside and out, and just like my grandmother, her smile would light up the world.

We started going out, and for the first time, I found someone who could see past the persona and reveal the heart of the little boy hidden deep inside of me behind many masks and the fake identity I had spent so much time and energy creating.

It didn't take long for her to realize that love gives freedom.

She said to me, "Nicholas, I really love you, but I believe you need to continue your journey by yourself and discover what you are looking for on your own."

She explained that what she had fallen in love with was my heart.

How could she see my heart? I had left it many years ago, broken into pieces on the path of life.

I was cold and frozen. It felt like I didn't have a heart anymore.

---

## Nancy's Background

Her upbringing was the opposite of mine. Her mother was an alcoholic. Her parents separated when she was very young. She left home at fifteen years old, working two jobs and taking responsibility for her brother because they were ready to commit suicide if they didn't escape the broken environment they lived in.

Through all these challenges, she had grandparents who loved her, believed in her, empowered her, and introduced her to Jesus.

She prayed fiercely and asked God, "When will I be happy?"

There was something different about Nancy. We connected at the spirit and soul level.

When we decided to go our own ways, she looked directly into my eyes, straight to my soul, and said, "One day I will marry you."

I was in shock.

Who would want to marry someone as crazy as me after getting to know me?

Was she the crazy one, or was she seeing something I couldn't see about myself?

We continued to be friends. We became best friends and confidants.

## Entry into the Nightlife (Ages 17-18)

I started hanging out with a different crowd of friends. They were not in the drug business, but they were deep in the nightlife scene.

I also went to college, but I faced many challenges when I realized I wouldn't be able to succeed without studying. This was no longer high school.

At the same time, I was trying to be a noble citizen by working a normal job at minimum wage. The drop in income was brutal. I had made thousands of dollars per week in my previous business, and now I barely made one thousand dollars per month working nonstop.

I hated being told what to do and when to do it.

A few weeks into my third job, I was fired once again.

I decided to drop out of school.

I started working in the nightlife scene in Toronto.

I became a creature of the night—darkness and obscurity.

Sex, drugs, and rock and roll.

No limits.
No boundaries.

I lived by night, slept by day, and repeated the cycle over and over again.

I was making crazy money indulging myself in the ephemeral, dark pleasures of this world.

---

## New York: The Big Apple (Age 18)

A friend explained to me that he had contacts in New York in the nightlife scene. He said that guys were making three to four times more money in one night than what we were making in Toronto.

A few weeks later, at the age of eighteen years old, I was on a plane heading to the Big Apple in pursuit of fame, money, and success.

This is when the true downfall into hell started.

New York—the city that never sleeps.

This is where I met a new friend called cocaine.

It was completely normal. Everyone was sniffing coke the same way they would take a drink. It was socially acceptable.

This friend made me feel like Superman. Fearless.

It boosted my ego. I felt like I was on top of the world.

I was extremely good-looking, fit, full of charm, highly manipulative, and knew how to work the game better than most.

I influenced many friends back home to follow me into the pit of hell.

I made more money than I could have ever dreamed of at my age, living like a rock star.

Five-star restaurants.
VIP access to the best clubs in the city.
A buffet of beautiful girls ready to do whatever it took to be part of the glamour and have access to more drugs.

All of this came at the expense of prostituting my values to make more money.

---

## Parents' Unconditional Love

Through all of this, even though I lied to my parents about my lifestyle—and they knew the truth—they never disowned me.

On the contrary, they loved me unconditionally and prayed for me intensively.

My mother kept repeating a verse from the book of Proverbs, chapter 22, verse 6:

"Train up a child in the way he should go, teaching him to seek God's wisdom and will for his abilities and talents, and even when he is old, he will not depart from it."

She would add that she believed in her heart that God would bring me back onto the right path. She heard Him clearly when He told her to come home and raise me in God's ways.

"You have a great calling on your life, Nicholas," she would say. "I didn't sacrifice my professional career for you not to accomplish the destiny God created for you before the foundation of time."

---

## The Voice Inside

Even in the midst of this lifestyle, I could tell something was different about me compared to my friends.

After hard nights of partying, they would feel the aftermath of drugs and alcohol the next day.

For me, it was much worse.

My soul would twist in agony, to the point of feeling like demons were battling for my life.

A voice inside me kept telling me that I was running away from my destiny and making cruel decisions that could cost me my life.

I hated that voice and those feelings.

I used more drugs and alcohol to sedate and silence them.

What I realize today is that I was fighting the nature of God within me—twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three hundred sixty-five days a year.

---

## Self-Made Millionaire (Age 21)

During the next three years, I traveled back and forth between New York and Canada, transferring large amounts of money and beginning to invest in real estate.

I also traveled to cities around the world—Tokyo, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Miami—working in the nightlife scene.

By the age of twenty-one years old, I had "made it."

I had made more than one million dollars.

I had several lucrative investments.

I was self-made.

---

## The Emptiness

The truth was that I was completely empty inside.

Alone.
Scared.
Wanting more.

This was not how it was supposed to feel.

I was supposed to feel fulfilled, happy, complete.

I had access to all the pleasure this world could offer, yet my soul was still in agony.

I bought a brand-new Corvette of the year and drove around town like the king of the hill.

I owned a beautiful penthouse in a trendy part of Canada and rented another penthouse in New York on 45th Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen.

All of it was driven by the pursuit of acceptance and approval.

## September 11th, 2001

On September 11th, 2001, I was traveling in a taxi with a friend toward downtown New York. It was early in the morning. The taxi driver told us that one of the Twin Tower buildings had been struck by a plane. We thought he was insane. Many people in the city are mentally impaired.

A few seconds later, we heard a loud noise above our heads. The driver turned on the radio, and the host screamed with a trembling voice that the second tower had just been hit and that the United States of America was under attack.

We were in complete disbelief.

The taxi dropped us off, and as we looked up, we saw the most devastating scene of our lives. Black smoke covered the sky. People were jumping from the towers to their own death.

We started walking toward the Twin Towers.

My friend, who was from the Middle East, said to me, "We should turn around. I'm telling you, they probably have bombs on the planes, and these towers will come down."

I replied, "That's impossible. These are the Twin Towers. You're crazy."

Six blocks from the towers, the inevitable happened.

The first tower came crashing down.

Thick clouds of smoke traveled down the streets and avenues. We turned around and started running for our lives.

A few blocks down, covered in ashes, we caught our breath and looked back. We could see the face of evil smiling at the devastating destruction.

Later that afternoon, while walking in Times Square, we could hear the sound of birds flying.

What in God's name had just happened?

Why was I there?

Did God have a message for me?

---

## Aftermath

The following months were extremely challenging. The city felt dead. Work was hard to find. Passing immigration became extremely complex with the new security measures, and transferring money from the United States to Canada became almost impossible.

We made the decision to move to New York and stay there most of the time, returning to Canada only for the holidays.
