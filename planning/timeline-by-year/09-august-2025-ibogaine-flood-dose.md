# August 2025: Ibogaine Flood Dose

## Arrival at Transcend Clinic

In August 2025, I arrived at **Transcend Clinic** in Cancun, Mexico.

I came in the deepest and darkest season of my life.

- Suicidal ideation
- Dependence on Zopiclone for sleep
- Chronic insomnia
- Unresolved trauma
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Panic attacks
- Deeply embedded limiting beliefs

Life was experienced through survival rather than presence.

I was ready for radical transformation—or death to the old self.

## The Flood Dose Ceremony

The flood dose is the primary Ibogaine experience—a full therapeutic dose designed to take you deep into the medicine's effects for 24-48 hours.

As the medicine entered my system, I felt it begin to work.

Not slowly, but like a flood.

A flood of awareness.

A flood of memory.

A flood of God's presence.

---

## "It Is Finished"

The first thing I heard was not a vision.

It was a voice.

Clear. Unmistakable. Divine.

**"It is finished."**

The same words Jesus spoke on the cross.

In that moment, I knew:

The battle I had been fighting for decades—it was over.

Not because I had won through effort.

Because Christ had already won.

The shame. The guilt. The fear. The condemnation.

*Finished.*

---

## The Visions

What followed was a series of visions and encounters that would take hours to fully describe. Here are the most significant:

### My Father

My father's face appeared before me—and then passed *through* me.

In that moment, I felt the weight of our relationship.

The love. The pressure. The ultimatum. The covenant.

I saw him not as the source of my wound, but as a wounded man himself.

A man who loved me deeply but didn't always know how to show it.

The covenant I had made—*just watch me*—was burned in that moment.

I forgave him. I released him. I received his blessing.

### My Son Maverick

My son's face appeared before me—and then passed through me.

God showed me: *You are not passing down pain. You are passing down promise.*

The generational curse stopped here.

My son would not carry my wounds.

He would carry my legacy of healing.

### My Daughter Perla

My daughter fell into my arms, crying.

She could feel all of my pain and suffering.

But this was not condemnation—it was reconciliation.

She was showing me that she had always felt me, even when I was hidden behind walls.

And now, because I had faced my pain, she was safe.

Our connection was restored.

### My Wife Nancy

Nancy appeared only briefly—her right eye looking deep into my soul from a distance.

At the time, I wondered why I couldn't go deeper with her.

Later, God would reveal: *You first had to make peace with your own pain. Only then could you feel hers.*

### My Grandmothers

Both of my grandmothers appeared to me.

**Grandmother Courchesne** sat in a rocking chair, beautiful sunlight on her face, her little round glasses, her white hair, and her green Bible—the one I still have—laying on her lap.

She simply smiled at me.

Her presence was the message: *Your faith journey began here. Her prayers are still bearing fruit.*

**Grandmother Simone** appeared with nothing but a beautiful smile.

Silent approval. Silent love. Silent peace.

The maternal line was blessing me.

### Sadek: The First Wound

I was taken back to my childhood and confronted the first wound of betrayal—Sadek, the boy who abused me.

For the first time, I did not run from this memory.

I faced it.

I grieved it.

I forgave.

Not for him—for me.

The chains that had bound me to that wound for thirty-five years were broken.

---

## The Three Covenants Burned

In the sacred space of the flood dose, I came before God's throne.

I saw Father God, Jesus at His right hand, Holy Spirit within my heart.

And I did what I had never fully done before:

**I renounced the three covenants.**

### Covenant 1: Love Equals Suffering
*I renounce the lie that love equals suffering.*
*I receive divine love that heals, not wounds.*

### Covenant 2: I Will Be My Own God
*I renounce the vow to become my own god.*
*I declare Jesus Christ as the Lord of my life.*

### Covenant 3: Just Watch Me
*I renounce the covenant with Mammon and the need to prove my worth.*
*I receive Kingdom identity—not through doing, but through being.*

Each covenant was burned on the altar of heavenly fire.

Each chain was broken by the blood of Jesus.

---

## The New Declaration

As the old covenants burned, new truth emerged:

**I am the son of I Am.**

**I am a king in the Kingdom of God.**

**I am a citizen of heaven.**

**I am an ambassador of God's Kingdom on earth.**

**I am an apostle in the marketplace.**

**I am a healer in the marketplace.**

**Bringing the lost travelers back home to Papa.**

---

## Divine Order Restored

God showed me the divine architecture of healing:

**Before (False Order):**
Humanity → activates → Soul
*My wounded humanity controlled my thoughts, emotions, and will.*

**After (Divine Order):**
Divinity → activates → Spirit → leads → Soul → governs → Body
*My spirit, in union with the Holy Spirit, now leads everything.*

This is what the Bible means when it says: *"Walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."*

---

## Freedom

When I woke after five hours of sleep the day after the flood dose, one word kept coming:

**Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.**

The suffering in my soul was completely gone.

My soul felt free.

For the first time in my life.

Not temporary relief.

Not numbed by medication.

Truly, deeply, spiritually free.

*"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."* — 2 Corinthians 3:17

*"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."* — John 8:36

---

## It Is Finished. And It Is Begun.

The flood dose was not the end.

It was the beginning.

The old Nicholas died on that table.

A new creation emerged.

Not through my effort.

Through surrender.

Through the blood of Jesus.

Through the sacred medicine God created.

**It is finished.**

**And it is begun.**
