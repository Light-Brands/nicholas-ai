# 2018-2021: Collapse and Crisis

## The Castle of Cards (2018-2019)

A couple of months after sitting in my big office, looking out the window, feeling like I had finally made it—the castle of cards came crashing down.

The company underwent a legal reorganization.

My position was abolished.

On the **26th of February**, I lost everything:

- The share options worth $7.9 million
- The title
- The lifestyle
- The international contract
- The team I led
- The purpose and cause I believed in

But the worst part?

**I lost my identity.**

Because my identity was grounded in **doing** and **having**—not in **being**.

I was so confused.

I didn't know who I was anymore.

I had lost the title.

I had lost the people I was leading.

I had lost the purpose that gave my life meaning.

By helping people with our medical weight loss protocol, I had believed we were transforming millions of lives.

On that day, I lost myself.

## The Spiral Begins

Since that day, it has been hell.

The confusion. The fear. The desperation.

Who was I without the title?

Without the corner office?

Without the private jets?

Without the recognition?

I had spent years building an identity based on external success.

Now that identity had been stripped away.

And underneath it was the same wounded little boy from age eight.

The same fear. The same shame. The same emptiness.

## Mental Health Collapse (2019)

Within months of losing my position, my mental health began to deteriorate rapidly.

The symptoms that had always lurked beneath the surface began to explode:

- Racing thoughts
- Insomnia
- Grandiosity
- Impulsive decisions
- Emotional volatility
- Periods of deep depression
- Episodes of hypomania

I was diagnosed with **Bipolar Disorder Type 2**.

The doctors prescribed medications:

- Mood stabilizers
- Antidepressants
- Sleep aids
- Anti-anxiety medications

For a time, the medications helped stabilize me.

But they also numbed me.

I felt disconnected from myself, from God, from reality.

## Hospitalizations

Over the next two years, I was hospitalized multiple times.

Each episode followed a similar pattern:

1. A period of relative stability
2. A trigger—financial stress, conflict, exhaustion
3. A rapid descent into either depression or hypomania
4. Increasing dysfunction
5. Hospitalization to stabilize

The hospital became a revolving door.

Each time I went in, I believed it would be the last time.

Each time I came out, I believed I was healed.

But the cycle repeated.

## The Search for Answers

During this season, I searched desperately for answers.

I tried:

- Different medications
- Multiple psychiatrists
- Therapy (individual, group, couples)
- Twelve-step meetings (AA, NA, ACA)
- Alternative treatments
- Meditation
- Breathwork
- Fasting
- Prayer

Some things helped temporarily.

Nothing seemed to heal the root.

I kept asking the same haunting question:

*Why am I still not healed?*

I had done everything the experts recommended.

I had been sober for years.

I had worked the steps.

I had built a successful career.

Yet here I was—more broken than ever.

---

## Relapses

In the midst of this mental health crisis, I relapsed.

Not once. Several times.

Each relapse was brief—days or weeks.

But each one was devastating.

The shame was overwhelming.

How could I relapse after eight years of sobriety?

How could I do this to my family?

How could I betray everything I stood for?

The relapses were not the cause of my crisis.

They were a symptom.

A desperate attempt to escape the unbearable pain inside.

## Nancy's Burden

Through all of this, Nancy carried an unbearable weight.

She held our family together while I was falling apart.

She managed the children.

She dealt with the financial chaos.

She endured my episodes—the anger, the withdrawal, the instability.

She bore the weight of keeping our kingdom from collapsing into ashes.

And she did it while carrying her own pain and wounds.

Looking back, I can see how much she suffered.

How much she sacrificed.

How much she loved—even when I was unlovable.

---

## The Darkness

There were moments during this season when I wanted to die.

Not in a dramatic, attention-seeking way.

But in a quiet, exhausted surrender.

The suicidal ideation was real.

The whispers of the enemy were constant:

*You're a failure.*

*You're a burden.*

*Your family would be better off without you.*

*Just end it.*

I fought those whispers with everything I had.

I called my sponsor.

I went to meetings.

I prayed.

I held on.

But the darkness was suffocating.

---

## The Question That Haunted Me

Throughout this entire season, one question haunted me:

*Why can't I heal?*

I had tried everything.

I had done the work.

I had surrendered.

Yet the cycles continued.

The pain persisted.

The brokenness remained.

I began to wonder if I was simply unfixable.

If some people are just too damaged.

If my wounds were too deep.

If my demons were too strong.

---

## A Glimmer of Hope

But even in the darkest moments, a small flame refused to die.

Something inside me—perhaps the prayers of my mother, the love of Nancy, the faith of my grandmother—kept whispering:

*There is more.*

*This is not the end.*

*There is healing beyond what you've tried.*

I didn't know what that healing looked like.

I didn't know where it would come from.

But I held onto that whisper.

That tiny flicker of hope.

It would eventually lead me to a sacred journey I could never have imagined.
