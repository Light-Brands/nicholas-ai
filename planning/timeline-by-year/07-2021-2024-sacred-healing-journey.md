# 2021-2024: Sacred Healing Journey

## The Decision to Stop Medication (2021)

After years on psychiatric medications—mood stabilizers, antidepressants, sleep aids—I made a radical decision.

With the guidance of my psychiatrist, I began tapering off all medications.

This was not a reckless decision.

It came from a deep conviction that the medications were treating symptoms, not healing the root.

I felt disconnected from myself.

Numb to my emotions.

Unable to access the deeper parts of my psyche that needed healing.

The tapering process was difficult.

My nervous system had become dependent on these substances.

The withdrawal effects were significant.

But I was determined to find another way.

## The Sabbatical

I entered what I now call my **sabbatical season**.

A time of stepping back from the world.

A time of going inward.

A time of searching.

I pulled away from business.

I pulled away from social obligations.

I focused on healing.

## Therapy and Inner Work

During this season, I engaged in deep therapeutic work:

- **Psychotherapy**: Weekly sessions exploring my past, my patterns, my wounds
- **Trauma therapy**: Beginning to touch the childhood abuse I had buried for decades
- **Spiritual direction**: Reconnecting with God in new ways
- **Somatic work**: Learning to listen to my body and nervous system
- **Breathwork**: Accessing altered states to process stored emotions
- **Journaling**: Hours of writing, reflecting, praying

I began to see the connections:

- The abuse at age eight created a fracture in my identity
- The first heartbreak reinforced the belief that love equals suffering
- The covenant to become my own god led to decades of rebellion
- The covenant to prove my success drove me to exhaustion
- The mask of "Nick" protected the wounded boy but kept him imprisoned

## Episodes Continue

Despite all this work, the episodes continued.

Depression would descend without warning.

Hypomania would surge without invitation.

Sleep remained elusive.

Anxiety persisted.

Each episode sent me back to the drawing board.

*What am I missing?*

*What is the root I haven't reached?*

*Why can't I break free?*

---

## The Search for Answers

I researched extensively.

I read books on:

- Trauma and the body
- Attachment theory
- Addiction and the brain
- Spiritual warfare
- Neuroscience and mental health
- Alternative treatments

I explored:

- Ketamine therapy
- TMS (Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation)
- Neurofeedback
- Intensive outpatient programs
- Residential treatment options

Some helped temporarily.

None reached the root.

## Financial Pressure

Throughout this season, financial pressure mounted.

Without a stable income and with significant medical expenses, we were burning through savings.

The stress of money—the same trigger that had haunted me my whole life—resurfaced.

The covenant I had made with Mammon was still operating.

Fear of failure.

Fear of losing everything.

Fear of not being able to provide.

The spirit of scarcity whispered constantly.

---

## Family Strain

The strain on my family was immense.

Nancy was exhausted.

She had been carrying the weight for years.

The children were growing up in an unstable environment.

They saw their father struggle.

They experienced the chaos of episodes.

They adapted in ways children should never have to.

I felt tremendous guilt and shame.

I was failing them.

I was failing as a husband.

I was failing as a father.

The very thing I had promised—to break the cycle—seemed to be slipping through my fingers.

---

## God's Presence

Yet through it all, God remained.

Not always in dramatic ways.

Often in whispers.

In scripture that spoke directly to my situation.

In songs that broke through the darkness.

In moments of unexpected peace.

In the steadfast love of Nancy who refused to give up.

In the innocent eyes of my children who still saw their father, not his failures.

I held onto the promise that there was purpose in this pain.

That God was working even when I couldn't see it.

That my mess would become my message.

## The Turning Point

By 2024, I had reached a new level of desperation.

Not despair—desperation.

The kind of desperation that drives you to seek answers you've never considered.

To knock on doors you've never approached.

To surrender in ways you've never surrendered.

I began hearing about **Ibogaine**—a plant medicine used for addiction and trauma treatment.

I heard testimonies of people whose lives had been radically transformed.

People who had tried everything else—just like me.

People who found healing in a matter of days that years of therapy couldn't provide.

I was skeptical.

I was also curious.

I began to research.

I began to pray.

I began to ask God: *Is this the path?*

---

## Preparing for the Unknown

What I didn't know then was that God had been preparing me for something beyond my imagination.

Every failed treatment, every relapse, every episode, every tear, every prayer—it was all leading somewhere.

The sabbatical season was coming to an end.

A new chapter was about to begin.

A chapter that would take me to Cancun, Mexico.

To a place called **Transcend Clinic**.

To an encounter with God through **Ibogaine** that would change everything.
