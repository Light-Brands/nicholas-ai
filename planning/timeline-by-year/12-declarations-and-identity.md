# Declarations and Identity

## Life Purpose Statement

**How does God want me to BE and BE seen in the world around me?**

I am totally dead to myself and reborn as a son of God, a Citizen of Heaven, and an Ambassador of Heaven's Kingdom on Earth.

I am love, peace, joy, happiness, freedom, abundance, prosperity, and victory.

My pursuit is to live every moment in oneness, in intimate union and communion with Jesus Christ in the garden of my heart and soul.

I have spiritual eyesight and insight to see my wife, Perla, Maverick, my family, my friends, my associates, and humanity the way Jesus sees them, and to love them and care for them like Jesus does.

My divine purpose and mandate are to transcend Jesus into humanity, to collaborate with Him in advancing and redeeming souls into God's Kingdom.

## The Trinitarian Self

### The Dark Warrior — The Body (Humanity)

My Dark Warrior is not darkness or evil.

He is my **humanity**, my **body**, the vessel that lives in the seen world through the five senses.

He is *Nick* — the part of me that endured pain, fought battles, and carries scars as proof of survival.

God revealed: *"I am your Dark Warrior. I have fought your darkest battles. Look at my scars."*

The body is meant to be **honored**, not shamed or worshiped.

It is the instrument through which heaven becomes visible on earth.

Its rightful place is **in service**, not in control.

### The Light Warrior — The Soul (Mind, Will, Emotions)

My Light Warrior is my **soul** — the inner world of thoughts, emotions, imagination, and choice.

This is *Nicholas* — the thinker, feeler, dreamer, and decision-maker.

The soul lives between the body and the spirit and acts as the **gatekeeper**.

Every day, it chooses who leads:

- The **body** (through senses, fear, appetite, reaction), or
- The **spirit** (through presence, truth, peace, and love)

Whoever empowers the soul becomes its master.

### The Creator — The Spirit (Union with the Holy Spirit)

At the core of my being, God revealed my **spirit** — not separate from Him, but **intertwined in oneness with the Holy Spirit**.

This is the *I Am* within me.

The place of divine identity.

The epicenter where God dwells and leads.

God revealed: *"You are a son of I Am. Your spirit is united with Mine. I dwell in you."*

The spirit is designed to **lead the soul**, and the soul is designed to **lead the body**.

---

## The Divine Order

**Spirit → Soul → Body**

When this order is honored:

- The spirit, in union with the Holy Spirit, brings truth and life
- The soul becomes illuminated, stable, and whole
- The body becomes a faithful servant and expression of heaven

When this order is reversed—when the soul listens to the body—disconnection, anxiety, dissociation, and suffering arise.

---

## The Trinity of Marriage

The revelation expands beyond the individual into covenant:

**Jesus + Nancy + Nicholas**

A trinity of marriage living in:

- Oneness
- Union
- Reconciliation

Producing:

- Divine health and healing
- Abundance and prosperity
- Eternal expansion and ascension

All in coherence with divine identity, mandate, and purpose.

---

## Core Identity Truth

I was never meant to live from the outside in.

I was created to live from the inside out.

I am:

- Reconciled
- Whole
- Present
- Aligned

Spirit, soul, and body in divine order.

Christ in me.

Me in Christ.

Not becoming.

**Being.**

---

## The Final Declaration

My body experiences time.

My soul interprets time.

But my spirit transcends time.

In the Eternal Presence of God, there is no past or future, only the eternal now.

This is the gift — to be present in His presence.

Here I discover Divine Peace, Joy, Freedom, and Stillness, now and forever.

There is no work to do, only to be, and to let it be.

**I am a son of I Am.**

**I am free.**

**I am healed.**

**I am aligned.**

**I am a king in God's Kingdom, an apostle and healer in the marketplace, a father to the fatherless, and a generational curse-breaker.**

**I walk not in performance, but in presence. Not in fear, but in faith. Not to prove, but to serve.**
