# 2001-2007: Businesses and Downfall

## Life in New York with Nancy (2001-2003)

I stayed in constant communication with Nancy throughout the years. When I decided to move permanently to New York, she rented my penthouse in Canada.

I had a girlfriend in Toronto, but I still invited her to come visit me in New York.

Nancy was also working in the nightlife scene. She had to support her brothers financially for some time, and she also chose the easy way of making money.

She fell in love with New York, found work easily, and decided to move in with me.

We were still just friends at that time.

Her love for me was unchanged. She treated me like a king. She knew what I loved and overwhelmed me with the fine things in life.

She wanted to see me happy.

I manipulated her—pushing her limits and stepping on her values, especially in regard to partying and fulfilling my dark sexual desires.

She would do anything to please me.

She had everything I was looking for in a woman, yet even when I tried, I couldn't let my heart fall in love.

Why?

## Nancy's Faith

One thing that always amazed me about Nancy was her persistence and consistency in getting on her knees every night and every morning to pray and read her Bible.

She believed and had faith that the best was yet to come and that God had an extraordinary plan for our lives.

Her faithfulness in keeping a connection to God always brought a beam of hope into my heart, despite the shame and guilt that convinced me I didn't deserve His mercy and grace because of my pride and selfishness that drove my choices.

## The Martial Arts Mentor

During that time, I met a gentleman in New York. He was sitting across from me at a bar and kept staring at me.

After a while, I became annoyed and walked over to speak with him.

"Do I know you?" I asked.

"No," he replied.

"Then why are you staring at me?"

He said, "I'm wondering what you're all about."

He offered me a drink, and we started talking.

He extended two fingers and said, "Squeeze as hard as you can."

I grabbed his fingers and squeezed as hard as I could, hoping to break them.

He laughed and said, "You squeeze like a girl."

Even though he was six-foot-four and weighed two hundred fifty pounds, I was ready to knock him out.

He quickly added, "I'm an eighth-degree black belt in Aikido and trained in Japan with Steven Seagal."

I released his fingers and thought to myself, thank God I didn't throw the first punch.

We spoke about our love for martial arts. He told me he owned a school in New Jersey and worked as an orthopedic doctor in New York.

I told him I wanted to restart martial arts training.

He invited me to meet him the next morning at the gym at 7:00 a.m., saying he would decide after one session whether I was worth training.

That night, I went to bed at 3:00 a.m. and set my alarm for 6:30 a.m.

I was not going to miss that opportunity.

I arrived at the gym ten minutes early.

To my surprise, he was already sitting at the juice bar waiting for me.

## Training and Mentorship

We went upstairs into a private room.

"Put your hands up and protect yourself," he said.

I had never been hit or slapped so many times in my life.

His speed was lightning fast.

I went home with black eyes, swollen lips, and blood in my mouth.

After the session, he said, "I don't think you have it in you."

I replied, "What are you talking about? I never quit."

"You're right," he said. "Same place, same time, two days from now."

This sensei became a mentor to me.

We trained together for two years, and I earned my black belt under his guidance.

We opened a small school in New York and began training others in the art of Aikido.

He also became a confidant and coach.

He saw great potential in me and encouraged me to reconnect with the dreams and visions I had as a child.

He told me I needed to make radical decisions about my life because the path I was on would only grow darker.

## Extreme Blendz: A New Dream (2003)

I began searching for new business opportunities.

I came into contact with the president of a U.S. franchise called **Extreme Blendz**. They operated a healthy juice bar concept, one of which was located in the Gold's Gym where I trained.

At that time, nothing like it existed in Canada.

A friend and I dreamed of taking the Canadian market by storm.

We invested a large amount of money and became the franchisor for Canada.

This required a one-hundred-eighty-degree change in direction—mindset, location, industry, and lifestyle.

This dream reignited a fire inside me.

Was this finally the exit from the poisonous, pitch-black darkness that filled my lungs, thoughts, and emotions every second of the day?

We moved back to Canada and opened our first location inside the new Florida Fitness gym in Ottawa.

We rented two beautiful condos in one of the most expensive high-rises in the city.

We worked eighty hours a week for the first six months.

## Collapse of the Exit Plan (2003-2004)

It didn't take long to realize that to make a decent profit, we would need to open many locations and sell thousands of protein shakes per day.

Even then, it was nothing compared to what we had made in the nightlife industry.

I had sold myself the idea that by leaving New York, I was also leaving behind drugs and alcohol.

That belief was an illusion.

We had left Egypt, but Egypt was still living inside us.

Party nights returned.

Sleepless nights followed.

Hallucinations and fear began to consume me after savage nights of drugs and alcohol.

I kept promising myself that this would be the last time, only to find myself craving that numbness again—relief from anxiety, panic, and fear.

I was succumbing to another descent into hell.

Pride, the allure of an expensive lifestyle, the persona I had built, and the greed for more fame and money drove my decisions.

I chose to keep the penthouse in New York.

I asked Nancy to return there every two months to work and financially support our lifestyle until I "made it" with the business.

How selfish and egocentric I had become.

I did not realize that addiction was quietly taking root deep within me.

## Mentors Along the Way

During that season, I met a man named John.

He opened a kickboxing and boxing club within the same fitness facility.

A strong friendship formed, and he became my kickboxing coach.

I believe God placed him in my life to bring light into my darkness.

He was inspiring and deeply knowledgeable in personal development.

He planted seeds of greatness in me—seeds that would take root later in my life.

## Gucci: A Gift for Nancy

Nancy had a deep, soul-level love for animals.

As a child, animals had helped her survive the cruelty of her upbringing.

They became her best friends and confidants.

There was a mutual, unconditional love between them.

I wanted to surprise her with a special Christmas gift.

I bought her a pug named Gucci.

Gucci brought immense joy and happiness into her life.

She became Nancy's constant companion and emotional anchor.

Gucci would later become a therapeutic support during the trials and tests that awaited us in the next decade.

## Betrayal and Business Collapse (2004)

Just over a year into this journey in Ottawa, everything began to spiral downward.

A competitor opened its doors in Canada called Booster Juice. Their franchisees bought supplies from a Canadian manufacturer and franchisor, while our franchisees were required to purchase supplies from the United States at one of the highest exchange rates in the last twenty years.

The dream of franchising the concept quickly turned into a nightmare.

At the same time, the gym where we had opened our flagship location went under bankruptcy protection.

People were no longer coming in to buy memberships—they were canceling them.

Our revenue dropped by sixty percent overnight.

Simultaneously, my business partner went behind my back and began opening franchises through another corporation.

I had no choice but to buy him out.

I plunged into deep anger.

I felt betrayed, abandoned, rejected, and treated unjustly.

I remember crying out to God, "Please help me."

Even though I had turned my back on Him, I kept Him as a spare tire—calling on His name whenever I felt myself hitting rock bottom.

---

## A Miraculous Sale

I put the business up for sale.

A miracle occurred.

Someone offered me seventy cents on the dollar for my total investment.

I took the offer.

Once again, we convinced ourselves that the solution was to move to another city and start fresh.

Behind the persona I had built over the years was a little boy—scared, with low self-esteem and fragile confidence.

The glamour and material success brought many friends for all the wrong reasons.

They offered me acceptance and approval, which fueled my ego.

In return, I played the role of the illusory king, spending money to keep everyone happy and under my control.

This lack of self-worth led me to forgive my business partner and reconcile with him.

After reconciliation, he joined me on the next venture.

## Toronto: The Move (2004)

Toronto, here we come.

It was 2004.

We rented a beautiful mansion in Woodbridge.

I drove a brand-new Cadillac Escalade EXT.

It was time to take the city by storm and make it big.

With a new wind in our sails, I decided I would change internally.

I would party only occasionally and focus on launching a new business.

I also committed to training seriously for martial arts competition.

We had a healthy amount of money from the sale of the franchise.

Our dream was to build a flourishing business before our savings ran dry.

I began applying personal development concepts I had learned from John.

To my surprise, they worked.

I distanced myself from nightlife and drugs for a time.

I began training at one of the top Muay Thai gyms in the city.

I made strong friendships and felt, for the first time in years, like part of a healthy, grounded community.

I thought we had finally escaped the vicious cycle that had been slowly killing us from the inside.

A new fire ignited within me.

I felt a happiness I had not experienced in decades.

## Zugari and the Return of Temptation (2005-2006)

One day, I received a call from an old friend who asked to meet.

He shared a business concept with me.

He was a very talented designer preparing to launch a high-end women's swimwear brand called Zugari.

As he described his experience in the industry, something inside me reacted immediately.

This was it.

I saw myself as a co-founder of a global luxury brand—beautiful models, fashion shows, exquisite lifestyles, parties in mansions and yachts.

Without hesitation, seduced by the idols of worldly fame, riches, seduction, and success, I shook his hand and said, "I'm in."

What happened to my good intentions?

What happened to my desire to change?

I convinced myself this time would be different.

I believed I could control alcohol and drugs.

I told myself I was now a mature businessman.

Like a sudden storm on a beautiful sunny day, the sky darkened.

Lightning, thunder, and rain consumed the scene.

I fell deeper than ever into obsession and compulsive pleasure.

Every time I tried to escape, darkness pulled me back in.

## M1 Boxing Academy

At the same time, I channeled my passion for discipline and peak performance into building **M1 Boxing Academy**—a Thai boxing and MMA gym complete with a strength and conditioning facility.

It was not just a fight gym.

It became a training ground for warriors—a place where people learned to master their bodies and minds.

One weekend, I was scheduled to fight in a Muay Thai tournament in Montreal.

My opponent never showed up.

That night, I drank myself nearly to death.

I had a major argument with Nancy that escalated into a physical altercation between me and one of my teammates.

The next morning, I remembered nothing.

For the first time in my life, I had blacked out completely.

The owner and coach of the academy confronted me.

He told me my behavior would not be tolerated and that I was no longer welcome.

I replied defiantly, "Just watch me."

I gathered a group of former teammates.

We decided to open our own gym a few blocks away.

We would compete directly.

---

## Towers on Sand

**Zugari**, my women's luxury swimsuit line, immersed me in the world of fashion and glamour—a world that fed the mask I wore: the image of Hollywood Nick, the high-flying, untouchable entrepreneur with the perfect life.

Meanwhile, **M1 Boxing Academy** became my tribute to discipline and dominance—a Thai boxing and MMA gym with cutting-edge strength and conditioning.

It was my personal fight club—a place where men came to toughen their bodies, push past pain, and train like warriors.

On the outside, I was thriving.

Real estate.
Fashion.
Fitness.
Nightlife.
Luxury cars.

On the inside, I was still that broken fifteen-year-old boy—terrified of suffering, terrified of love, terrified of silence.

Every new venture was another attempt to outrun my wounds.

Every dollar I made was proof that I was winning.

But in the kingdom of my soul, I was building towers on sand.

These businesses grew—and so did my ego.

No amount of money, sex, adrenaline, or applause could heal what was fractured deep inside.

The same inner vow—*just watch me*—kept me climbing, performing, and hiding, even as the cracks widened.

## May 2007: Hitting the Wall

My mother kept telling me that I could not continue living this destructive lifestyle.

She said I was going to hit a wall—somehow, somewhere.

I was doomed, she told me. I had a praying mother, a praying grandmother, and many others interceding for my life.

In May 2007, the inevitable happened.

I hit the wall at full speed.

One night, while Nancy was in New York, I went out partying.

The next day, something tragic happened.

I cannot describe it fully in words.

To the best of my understanding, the persona I had created since the age of sixteen—the one I had fed with all my energy, focus, and attention—became a monster and turned against me.

I felt demons battling for my life and my soul.

I lost total control.

I became insane.

I began self-medicating with alcohol.

A lot of alcohol.

I drank forty to sixty ounces of hard liquor every day.

I needed to shut down my brain.

I was empty.

I was void.

Shame and guilt consumed me.

The spirit of death whispered in my ear, telling me I deserved this and inviting me to follow.

I could not live with myself anymore.

I hoped to drink myself to death and never wake up.

This cycle repeated daily.

My soul felt torn apart.

My entire being slipped rapidly toward the abyss.
