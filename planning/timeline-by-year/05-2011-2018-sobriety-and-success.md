# 2011-2018: Sobriety and Success

## Eight Years Sober

From 2011 to 2018, I maintained eight consecutive years of sobriety.

This was the longest stretch of freedom I had experienced since that first drink at age fifteen.

I worked the twelve steps with dedication.

I sponsored men.

I attended meetings regularly.

I built a foundation of recovery.

I believed I had finally conquered the demon.

## Ideal Protein: The Rise (2011-2018)

During this season, a significant career opportunity emerged.

I joined a company called **Ideal Protein**—a medically developed weight loss protocol.

What started as a sales position quickly evolved into something far greater.

I had found my calling in the business world.

The company aligned with my values of health, transformation, and helping people.

I rose through the ranks rapidly.

Within a few years, I became **Vice President of Sales**.

I was responsible for expanding the protocol across North America and internationally.

I traveled the world.

First class.

Private jets.

Five-star hotels.

I trained thousands of health professionals.

I spoke on stages.

I led teams.

I was *making it*.

## The Ideal Way

During this time, I also co-founded **The Ideal Way**—a coaching and consulting company focused on personal development and leadership.

This was the integration of everything I had learned:

- The twelve-step principles
- The personal development teachings from mentors like John
- The lessons from my failures and successes

I began coaching executives, entrepreneurs, and professionals.

I helped them transform their lives in four key areas:

1. **Body** – Physical health and vitality
2. **Being** – Identity, mindset, and emotional mastery
3. **Balance** – Relationships, family, and life integration
4. **Business** – Entrepreneurship, leadership, and wealth creation

This framework became my signature.

I believed I had cracked the code.

## The Appearance of Success

On paper, I had everything:

- A beautiful wife
- Two healthy children
- A senior executive position
- A growing coaching business
- Financial stability
- International recognition
- Eight years of sobriety

The little boy who had left home at sixteen with nothing had proven everyone wrong.

*Just watch me.*

The covenant I had made with my father seemed fulfilled.

I had made it.

---

## But Something Was Missing

Despite all the external success, something inside me remained unsettled.

I was still driven by the need to prove myself.

My identity was still rooted in **doing** and **having**—not **being**.

I worked long hours.

I traveled constantly.

I pushed my body to extremes.

I neglected my family more than I wanted to admit.

I was a high performer—but I was running on empty.

The wounds from childhood, the abuse, the heartbreak, the covenants I had made—none of them had been truly healed.

They had been suppressed by success.

They had been numbed by achievement.

But they were still there.

Waiting.

---

## The Share Options

At Ideal Protein, I was granted significant share options.

The value grew over time.

By the end, my options were worth over **$7.9 million** on paper.

This was the ultimate validation.

I had gone from drug dealer to millionaire executive.

From rock bottom to the top floor.

I remember sitting in my corner office one day, looking out the window, and thinking:

*I made it. I actually made it.*

For a moment, I felt complete.

But that moment was brief.

---

## The Covenant Fulfilled—Or Was It?

The covenant I had made at sixteen—*just watch me, I'll become successful no matter what*—had driven me for decades.

Now it seemed fulfilled.

But instead of peace, I felt emptiness.

Instead of satisfaction, I felt a haunting question:

*Is this all there is?*

I had climbed the mountain.

I had reached the summit.

But the view from the top revealed a deeper truth:

**Success built on wounded foundations cannot stand.**

My identity was grounded in **doing** and **having**—not in **being**.

I did not know who I was without the title, the role, the achievements.

I was about to find out.

---

## The Warning Signs

By 2018, the cracks were beginning to show.

I was exhausted—physically, mentally, emotionally.

I had pushed myself to unsustainable limits.

The travel. The pressure. The performance.

My body was signaling distress.

My mind was racing.

My relationships were strained.

I was still sober—but I was not well.

The same patterns that had led to my breakdown in 2007 were resurfacing.

The same drive. The same intensity. The same avoidance of inner pain.

Only this time, it would lead to an even greater collapse.

---

## A Season of Achievement

Looking back, 2011-2018 represents both triumph and tragedy.

**The triumph:**
- Eight years without alcohol or drugs
- Career success beyond my wildest dreams
- A platform to help thousands of people transform their lives
- A family that loved me

**The tragedy:**
- The underlying wounds remained unhealed
- My identity was still tied to performance
- I was building on sand
- The crash was coming

This season taught me that **sobriety is not the same as healing**.

You can be sober and still be sick.

You can be successful and still be suffering.

You can have everything the world values and still be empty inside.

True healing requires going deeper.

It requires facing the roots.

It requires dying to the false self.

And that death was about to come—whether I was ready or not.
