# My Story: Introduction

## **Godzillionnaire**

Your tests become your testimony, your trials become your triumphs, your mess becomes your message, and a miracle to someone else.

It was a beautiful hot and sunny morning. As I was walking in the forest, the sun was creating these beautiful beams of light piercing through the leaves and creating this wonderful tapestry mixed with the melody of the birds singing with joy.

Suddenly, I came to this open field, with a beautiful stream coming down the mountain. I started to walk toward the water. As I looked far away, there was a bench alongside the stream, and someone was sitting there looking at the scenery. Something inside invited me to walk toward the bench.

As I came closer, I could tell it was a child sitting down. When I arrived a few feet away, I was completely in shock. The child sitting on that bench was me at the age of eight years old.

Through his innocent big blue eyes, he looked at me. Tears came down his cheeks. He reached out his hand and said:

"Can you promise to love me, care for me, protect me, and activate me in becoming everything God created me to be for the rest of your life?"

I woke up. I was thirty-nine years old.

## The Seventeen-Year Battle

For seventeen years, I have fought a relentless war—not just for sobriety, but for identity, wholeness, and truth.

What began as a struggle with alcohol in 2007 evolved into a sacred search for healing—a path that took me through addiction, recovery, mental health diagnoses, business collapse, spiritual awakening, and ultimately, a radical return to God.

My battle with addiction started in 2007, the first time I truly lost control of alcohol. Over the next three years, I went to rehab three times. From 2011 to 2018, I maintained eight consecutive years of sobriety. Across the full seventeen-year arc, I have been sober for fourteen of those years—not in one stretch, but through countless cycles of relapse and redemption.

Every fall carried shame, confusion, and the same haunting question:

*Why am I still not healed?*

But I didn't quit.

I fought with everything I had—twelve-step programs, step work with my sponsor, psychologists, counselors, psychotherapists, spiritual mentors, and thousands of hours of self-inquiry. Each relapse was brief—days or weeks—but each one was devastating. I kept getting up, but I knew something deeper was broken within me.

## The Final Revelation

This is no longer just my healing journey. It is my life's mission.

My relapses were not failures. They were initiations.

My wounds are not defects. They are doors.

My suffering is not senseless. It is sacred.

I now know I was never broken. I was being rebuilt.

Every time I rise from the pit, I carry more light for those still trapped in darkness.

I have been called to help men, families, and leaders confront the lies that bind them—and return home to the truth of who they are in God.

This is my battle.
This is my blueprint.
This is my calling.
