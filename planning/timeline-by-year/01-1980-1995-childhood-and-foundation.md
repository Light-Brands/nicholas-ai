# 1980-1995: Childhood and Foundation

## Birth and Early Years (1980-1984)

I was born on the 15th of December, 1980. I was blessed to have two amazing parents who loved me unconditionally. My first memories are infused with peace, joy, and harmony.

My grandmother on my Dad's side raised me until the age of four years old while my mother was the assistant director of the National Bank and my Dad was teaching ski and bartending. During that time, my grandmother raised me with excellence, love, peace, and joy. The heart of gold and goodness of this lady left a mark in my soul that will never be erased.

## Family Transformation (1984-1988)

While I was approaching four years old, my mother had a spiritual awakening. Her life would forever be transformed. She met God, her Creator and Father. He spoke to her and invited her on a new journey, a journey that would change her destiny. He invited her to sacrifice her professional career and come home to raise her son in God's way. She accepted the invitation.

My Dad was in unbelief. He couldn't understand what was happening to my mother and was really disturbed by the transformation in her life. My mother would bring me to Bible studies each Friday night and Sundays. She would pray and have faith that what God united, He would not separate.

At an early age, I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior into my life.

One night, my Dad was having a late dinner. I was playing with my toys on the kitchen floor. I stood up, sat on a chair beside him, looked at him straight in his eyes, and said to him:

"If you don't accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior in your heart, you will go to hell, but if you do, you will come to heaven with Mommy and me."

I turned around, went back to playing with my toys, and left my Dad astonished, digesting these few powerful words that came out of his little boy's heart.

The following Sunday, he came with us to church and made the greatest decision of his life. He accepted Jesus into his heart.

## A Home Filled with Faith

From that moment, the inner and outer dynamic of our family was completely changed. My Dad changed careers. He left behind the nightlife and became a car salesman. Financially, it had a major impact. Only one salary was coming in, and it was much leaner than the previous two jobs my Dad used to work.

What still amazes me today is the fact that we never lived poor-minded. We trusted God. Our needs were always met, and we lived in an abundance of love, peace, and joy.

I remember one time at the end of the month when my parents were short financially. They did not have enough to cover the mortgage and gas for my Dad to go to work. They prayed fiercely. The next day, someone came to our house and handed an envelope to my Dad. He said he felt in his heart to bless us with a specific amount. The amount of the check was exactly what was needed to cover the mortgage, and an extra twenty dollars covered the gas.

As long as I can remember, our life was constantly covered by God's supernatural fingerprints.

## Childhood and Formation

My upbringing was fulfilled by activities and sports. I didn't have any siblings. My Dad was my best friend. He would play with me for hours. My mother was the wild one. She brought me to do crazy activities and always empowered and motivated me to push my limits.

We didn't have a television at home. We used our creativity to build treehouses, a hockey rink in our backyard during winter, skateboarding ramps, and excursions in the forest playing GI Joe. We went swimming, played tennis, soccer, karate, rock climbing, and many other sports.

My Dad put me in a hockey league where I excelled. That is when the entrepreneurial spirit came alive in me. I would go back home and invite friends to come to our house on Saturday mornings to learn how to play hockey. I would teach them what I learned during practice and charged them twenty-five cents per lesson. My first business was born.

## Extended Family and Community

We would also spend March break and two weeks during the summer at my grandmother's house by Blue Sea Lake with my cousins. We built a cabin in the woods where we would sleep and enjoy my Dad playing guitar while the family sang around a campfire.

Skidoo, four-wheelers, dirt bikes, cars, fishing boats—these were part of our everyday activities. We were young, full of life, and enjoying every minute.

We also traveled every year to church conferences in Montreal, the Laurentians, and Thunder Bay, camping along the way and enjoying the beautiful scenery.

## Open Hearts, Open Home

Our home welcomed many people who stayed with us for a time—friends, family, and my grandmother on my mom's side. She inspires me to this day. She was the mother of fifteen children, lived in poverty, lost her husband and a son to suicide, and worked three jobs.

I never heard her complain. She sang all the time, and she had a smile that lit up the world.

My parents always opened the door of our home and their hearts to anyone in need. They loved people unconditionally, and each one left inspired and impacted by the atmosphere of love, peace, and joy inhabiting our home.

I realized at a very young age that many people have a house, but very few have a home. We had a home.

## Seeds of Faith

Many friends and family members gave their lives to Jesus because they saw more than they heard the fruits of transformation in our life and home.

Both my grandmothers became prayer warriors. When they left to be with Jesus, we felt the void of their answered prayers in our life.

As a family, we took time each morning and each night to read the Bible, pray, worship, and give grace before each meal.

My mother would come to my bedside every night, and we would recite three verses from the Bible. I remember how they uplifted my spirit as a little boy, and I remember them to this day.

From an early age, I learned to be grateful for the abundance of life and even the small things that made us so happy.

## The Gift of Communication

The gift of communication came to me at a young age. I would sit my parents and grandmother in a circle, and with the help of a whiteboard, I would teach and preach what I learned during Bible studies at church.

This was the beginning of my public speaking.

---

## The Shadow: Understanding My Roots

To understand my battle, you must understand my roots.

I was raised in a strict, closed-brethren Christian assembly where church was our whole life. We had no TV, no radio, no access to culture beyond our walls. I was overprotected and taught to fear God more than love Him. I learned rules, not relationship; doctrine, not connection; fear, not grace.

And in that same church, my innocence was stolen.

An older boy abused me for three years—from age eight to eleven—twisting my trust, silencing my voice, and fracturing my sense of self.

## Dreams and Visions

My eagerness to connect with God was still at an all-time high. I had dreams and visions of traveling the world, preaching Jesus, and becoming a missionary. In my young mind, I tried to connect my entrepreneurial spirit with a calling to ministry. I always hated the poverty mindset and believed there would be a way to create for-profit businesses to support ministry.

I remember the first time I heard that it was possible to become more than a millionaire—that someone could become a billionaire. Something shifted in my spirit.

The following Sunday at church, an older lady asked me, "Nicholas, what do you want to become when you grow older?"

I responded without hesitation, "Madame, I will become a billionaire."

She replied, "Well, you know, Nicholas, that money is the root of all evil?"

I responded, "No, Madame. The love of money is the root of all evil. How can I bless millions of people if I don't make billions of dollars?"

No one answered. That was the end of the conversation. I was twelve years old.

---

## Suppression and Confusion

The church we attended had amazing Bible studies but was also very religious at its core and stood on many doctrines that I do not believe today reflect the will of God for our lives.

I would share the dreams and visions I had about entrepreneurship and life with church members and was always met with similar responses—that these dreams were not from God but from the world.

This suppression of what I felt was my purpose, passion, and desire made me very confused.

## First Love and First Fall (Age 14-15)

At fourteen years old, I met a beautiful young lady. I felt completely in love. I had never felt this type of emotion before. I couldn't get her out of my mind.

We started going out, and my life became a love story. She knew I was different because of my upbringing and accepted me just as I was.

Nothing else mattered. I loved her with all my heart and believed she would become my wife and that we would live happily ever after.

Love made me blind. I started making choices that went against my beliefs and values.

One night, I went to a friend's party with my girlfriend and tasted alcohol for the first time. Suddenly, all my insecurities, differences, and fears disappeared. For the first time in my life, I felt like I was part of the tribe.

Not long after, I gave her my virginity, convincing myself she was the one.

I started lying and manipulating my parents to make them believe we were only friends.

---

## The First Heartbreak

Nine months into our relationship, one evening she told me she didn't love me anymore and was breaking up with me.

My world shattered.

Never before had I felt real suffering and pain like this. I struggled to breathe. I became deeply depressed and didn't want to live.

I asked myself how a good God could allow His child to suffer so much. Why was life so cruel?

Pain is inevitable—but suffering is a choice.

That day, I chose to suffer.

I made a vow: I would never let myself fall in love again. I would never let myself suffer like this again.

Love meant suffering, and suffering became my greatest fear.

Worse, I turned my back on God and crowned myself my own god.
