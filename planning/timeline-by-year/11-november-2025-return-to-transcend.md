# November 2025: Return to Transcend

## 90 Days of Living in Presence

Ninety days after my sacred journey with God through Ibogaine, I am no longer living in reaction, regret, or anticipation.

**I am living in presence.**

Presence is my temple, my compass, and my sanctuary.

I no longer time-travel through guilt into the past or through fear into the future.

I can look at the past to learn and look into the future to co-create with the Holy Spirit, but always from the **present moment**, where my spirit is intertwined with His in the garden of my heart and soul.

My internal compass is **peace and joy**.

When peace fades or joy dims, I know I have stepped outside of presence.

I return through breath, prayer, and gratitude—re-entering the garden with God.

## The Transformation

Three months ago, I entered Transcend Clinic during the deepest and darkest season of life.

- Suicidal ideation
- Dependence on Zopiclone for sleep
- Chronic insomnia
- Unresolved trauma
- Depression
- Anxiety
- Panic attacks
- Deeply embedded limiting beliefs

**Today:**

- Full freedom from all psychiatric and sleep medication
- Natural sleep restored: 7-8 hours per night
- 40-50% in deep and REM sleep
- Anxiety dissolved
- Depression symptoms absent
- Nervous system stabilized
- Mind calm
- Body regulated
- Soul present

---

## The Healing Runs Deep

Personal trauma has been faced directly and integrated with compassion rather than avoidance.

In addition, generational trauma extending **five generations deep** has been acknowledged, processed, and released.

What once lived unconsciously in the nervous system no longer dictates identity, behavior, or emotional reality.

For the first time in my life, there is sustained residence in the present moment.

The past no longer pulls through guilt, shame, or regret (which previously manifested as depression).

The future no longer pulls through fear (which previously manifested as anxiety).

Time itself feels slower and fuller.

Life is experienced **moment by moment** rather than through mental projection.

---

## Visible Changes

This internal shift is externally visible.

My children, ages eleven and thirteen, consistently reflect increased presence, intentionality, and emotional availability from their father.

Relationship has replaced reactivity.

Being has replaced performance.

At the core of this transformation is restored identity.

Love, validation, and acceptance are no longer sought externally.

They are received directly from God, embodied internally, and then expressed outwardly through overflow into marriage, parenting, and community.

Life is now lived from alignment rather than effort, from purpose rather than proving, from **being rather than doing**.

## The Bufo Ceremony

Upon returning to Transcend, I experienced **Bufo (5-MeO-DMT)**—known as "God's molecule."

If Ibogaine was the surgical tool that cleansed and rewired, Bufo was the **vertical awakening** that dissolved the ego and revealed the eternal truth of unity, presence, and divine oneness.

In Bufo, identity collapsed into pure Being.

Time disappeared.

The soul remembered God.

The experience was instantaneous, infinite, and non-dual.

It did not teach through narrative but through **absolute knowing**.

### The Integration

**Bufo reveals truth.**

**Ibogaine installs truth.**

**Integration lives truth.**

Used together, they create a **Heaven-to-Earth transmission**:

- Bufo shows you who you are eternally
- Ibogaine teaches you how to live that truth as a human

## The Vision: White Horse and Army of Light

During my Iboga booster 48 hours after Bufo, I received a powerful vision:

I was riding a **white horse**, crowned with light and precious stones, moving with power and purpose beneath a radiant living sun.

The thunder of hooves echoed through eternity—momentum, authority, divine movement.

Behind me rode a vast **army of radiant souls**, a divine army of light.

At my side rode my brother Olivier, also on a white horse.

Together, we advanced as sons of I Am, carrying the banner of Heaven across the Earth.

As shadows attempted to rise—fog, debris, fragments of darkness—there was no battle of force.

Instead, a single unified act of alignment: a look, a clap, an instantaneous explosion of light.

Darkness dissolved completely.

**Light does not fight darkness—it simply eliminates it by presence.**

---

## Transcend Revealed

Within this vision, the true nature of Transcend Clinic was revealed:

It is not merely a treatment center.

It is a **divine laboratory**, a holy matrix of awakening.

It functions as the **red pill of God**—a mechanism of remembrance where humanity recalls its true nature, origin, and divine identity.

## The Baptism of Love: Second Ibogaine Booster

The day after my first booster, Dr. Mariana came to see me.

"Are you ready for your second booster dose?" she asked.

I was surprised—I thought I was done.

But something deeper was inviting me.

I said yes.

This booster was different.

After about an hour, I began to feel **raw, unbearable pain**.

Waves of suffering rose through my body and soul.

And then, revelation:

**It wasn't my pain. It was hers. It was Nancy's pain.**

For the first time in my life, I felt the depth of her heartbreak, her despair, her loneliness, her wounds.

It was almost too much for my human flesh to bear.

### The Battle

The voice of shame rose up:

*"You deserve this. Feel it. You're responsible. Carry it. Be guilty. Be ashamed."*

Images of relapse and betrayal flashed before my eyes.

And in that torment, God spoke:

**"It is your love, Nicholas. Your love will dissolve your pain."**

I wept. "Why? How could she stay? How could she love me after all this?"

**"I gave her a soul contract—to love you into awakening, to bring you into remembrance of who you truly are."**

### The Morning After

When I woke the next morning, there was complete peace.

I called Nancy, saw her face, and broke.

I sobbed uncontrollably—tears of surrender, of love, of truth.

God revealed:

*"Son, you couldn't go deep with her during the flood dose. First, you had to make peace with your own pain. Only then could you feel hers."*

Now I felt it—all of it.

Not as punishment, but as **communion**.

Because only when you have embraced your own suffering can you **love** another's with compassion.

## Eternal Presence

The deepest revelation of this return:

**I am not a human searching for God.**

**I am an eternal spirit, animated by God, living a human experience in the seen realm.**

Through these sacred medicines, I encountered the essential qualities of divine reality directly:

- Infinite love
- Peace
- Stillness
- Calm
- Presence
- Oneness

These were not emotional states—they were **ontological realities**, the very atmosphere of God Himself.

**Time does not exist as an absolute reality in God.**

Time is a construct of the human mind.

God exists outside of time, in the eternal *now*.

And because the human spirit originates in God, the spirit also lives beyond time.

My body experiences time.

My soul interprets time.

But **my spirit transcends time**.

In the Eternal Presence of God, there is no past or future—only the eternal now.

---

## The Gift

This is the gift—to be present in His presence.

Here I discover Divine Peace, Joy, Freedom, and Stillness, now and forever.

There is no work to do, only to be, and to let it be.

Bufo and Iboga were created by God as sacred doorways into this higher awareness of consciousness.

Through them, I remember what has always been true—that the Eternal Kingdom is within me.

Now that I have seen and known this truth, I carry the compass of knowing forever.

I may choose to descend back into lower states of survival, but I will never again forget that I am free to live in the ascended state of divine consciousness—the Presence of I AM.
