# 2007-2011: Rehabilitation and Marriage

## Nancy's Return and the Intervention (June 2007)

I was supposed to pick up Nancy at the airport one night.

I was so intoxicated that I didn't make it.

When Nancy arrived at the mansion, she was in complete shock.

I was almost dead.

She immediately called people from my past who could help me.

I also reached out to a friend from the gym who had been sober for many years.

He came to the mansion and spoke with me about my predicament.

I shared with him what had happened and what I was feeling.

He became silent for a few seconds and then said:

"I came from a similar place. If you don't stop drinking, you will die."

He told me about Alcoholics Anonymous and said there were people just like me in the meeting rooms.

For the first time in years, I felt a flicker of hope.

---

## First Steps Toward Recovery

He asked if I wanted him to help me.

I said yes.

He told me the first thing I had to do was get detoxed.

After my detox, he would take me to meetings and help me get sober.

We called my family.

My mother found a rehabilitation center in Montreal.

Days later, Nancy, my sister—whom my mother had while I was living in New York—and I drove to Montreal.

I was checked into the rehabilitation center.

I spent sixteen days there.

When I came out, I felt much better physically.

My brother from New York flew in.

We picked up Nancy and flew down to Mexico.

The plan was to take some time to reflect and let the ocean speak to our souls.

When we landed in Mexico, we made a foolish decision.

Celebration was in order.

Within hours of landing, we relapsed.

The following week was one savage event after another.

We returned home worse than before.

I had spent a significant amount of money on the trip plus the cost of rehab.

Money was beginning to run out.

This was yet another failed attempt at trying to change.

---

## Deeper Into Darkness

I continued drinking for the next six months.

For a brief time, I attended meetings.

Each time I would string together a few days of sobriety, I found a reason to drink again.

I blamed the rehab for my failure.

My mind had been clearer after those sixteen days—but not clear enough.

The disease had already taken root.

This time, I became what one would call a high-functioning alcoholic.

I ran the businesses during the day and drank all evening.

For a time, I didn't touch drugs.

I lied to myself, thinking I only had an issue with drugs and that alcohol was not the problem.

My brain needed relief from the vicious mental attacks it had been under for months.

The alcohol provided temporary relief—and the devil laughed at my denial.

Things only got worse.

My behaviors under the influence brought me into a savage state.

I hurt Nancy in ways I had never done before.

I called people to inflict damage and vengeance on old enemies.

I woke up in strange places having no idea how I got there.

Then one day, I woke up in jail.

The officer told me I had been arrested for assaulting a female police officer.

I had no memory of what had happened.

I pleaded to the officer, saying I was not the kind of guy who would hurt a woman.

I asked him to check whether the officer was all right.

He came back and told me the officer had filed her report.

She had written that I was extremely intoxicated and became violent.

When she approached me to calm me down, she tripped, fell, and hurt her shoulder.

I had not touched her.

It was her word against mine.

I was a registered criminal, heavily intoxicated, and I clearly remembered nothing.

Fortunately, the video camera told the truth.

I was still charged with public intoxication and held for a few more hours.

The charges were eventually dropped after my attorney intervened.

I made the decision to escape once again.

I left for the Dominican Republic.

I would drink by the ocean, feel sorry for myself, and rest.

Two weeks later, I returned home in even worse condition.

## The Snowstorm and a Voice (Winter 2007-2008)

After another night of drinking at the mansion, I woke up in the middle of a snowstorm, lost in the middle of nowhere.

I was freezing—close to hypothermia.

I had walked away from the mansion and into the forest behind the property.

After hours of wandering, I lost all sense of direction.

It was pitch black, and I saw no lights in the distance.

I was exhausted and couldn't walk any farther.

I sat down and began to cry, ready to surrender my life to the cold.

Then I heard a voice.

It told me to stand up.

I did.

To my left, through the trees and the snow, I saw a light in the distance.

I walked toward it.

I knocked on the door.

A man opened it, looked at me, and said I looked like death.

He sat me by the fireplace and gave me hot chocolate.

His wife called the mansion.

Nancy and the others had been searching for me in a panic.

When Nancy picked me up, something inside me shifted.

I could not understand what had happened.

Was it God?

I wasn't ready to accept Him back into my life.

## Return to Rehab

After many more meetings with friends in sobriety, I made the decision to enter a real rehabilitation center—a thirty-day program with counseling, step work, and accountability.

The center was in Alberta.

I spent thirty days there.

For the first time, I truly believed there was hope for me.

I participated in everything.

I followed the counselors' recommendations.

I believed this time would be different.

I returned to Toronto ready to restart my life.

Everything was on track.

I attended meetings every day.

I got a sponsor and started working the twelve steps.

After sixty days of sobriety, something tragic happened.

My first sponsor relapsed and overdosed.

I attended his funeral.

I was devastated.

Once again, I questioned the program.

Was it really possible to live without alcohol and drugs?

Was it worth it?

I had seen this man with years of sobriety and a strong foundation.

How could this happen?

Was I next?

I relapsed.

I drank for a couple of weeks and returned to rehab.

---

## Third Rehab and a New Beginning

This time, I went to a rehab center in the Laurentians.

After another thirty days, I returned home ready to fight.

This time, I found a sponsor who had solid sobriety.

He became a mentor and a father figure.

My mother and father came to visit me.

My business partners, with my consent, had sold the businesses and exited me from the remaining ventures.

I had lost almost everything material.

But for the first time in years, I felt clarity.

I was ready to rebuild.

---

## Marriage to Nancy (2008)

After many years of friendship, love, and companionship, I asked Nancy to marry me.

She said yes.

We got married in a small ceremony surrounded by close family and friends.

Nancy had stood by me through the darkest chapters of my life.

She had seen me at my worst and still believed in who I could become.

She saw the little boy behind the mask.

She loved him unconditionally.

That day, I made a vow before God to honor her, protect her, and love her for the rest of my life.

I also made a silent vow to stay sober.

For her. For us. For the life we would build together.

---

## Early Recovery and Relapses (2008-2011)

The first years of marriage were challenging.

I was learning to live sober.

I worked hard in the twelve-step program.

I got involved in service.

I sponsored other men.

I prayed and read spiritual literature.

But the underlying wounds had not been healed.

The trauma was still there—buried deep.

During those years, I had a few short relapses.

Each one was devastating.

Each one brought shame and guilt.

But each time, I got back up.

I returned to meetings.

I called my sponsor.

I surrendered again.

Nancy never gave up on me.

Neither did God.

---

## The Children

During this season, Nancy and I were blessed with two beautiful children.

First, a daughter—**Perla**.

Then, a son—**Maverick**.

They became the center of our world.

For the first time, I understood what it meant to love unconditionally.

Looking into their eyes, I saw innocence, trust, and hope.

I made a promise to myself and to God:

I would break the cycle.

I would not pass down my pain.

I would become the father they deserved.

The father I never fully had.

The father I always needed.

---

## A New Foundation

By 2011, I had strung together consistent sobriety.

Not perfect—but growing.

I had rebuilt my life from the ashes.

I had a family.

I had a foundation.

I had hope.

I was ready for the next chapter.
