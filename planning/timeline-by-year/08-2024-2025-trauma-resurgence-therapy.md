# 2024-2025: Trauma Resurgence Therapy

## Meeting Paul

In 2024, I began working intensively with a psychotherapist named **Paul**.

Paul specialized in **Trauma Resurgence Therapy**—a method designed to safely access and process deep-rooted trauma stored in the body and nervous system.

Our sessions went deeper than any therapy I had experienced before.

Paul helped me see that my decades of struggle were not random.

They were the predictable result of unprocessed childhood trauma intersecting with inherited generational wounds.

---

## The Two Selves

Through our work together, Paul helped me understand the **actor vs. director** dynamic that had governed my life.

**The Actor (Nick)**: The persona I created after leaving home at sixteen. Confident. Charming. Ruthless. A survivor who would do whatever it took to succeed. This was the mask I wore to protect the wounded boy inside.

**The Director (Nicholas)**: The wounded core self. The eight-year-old boy who was abused. The fifteen-year-old whose heart was shattered. The soul longing for love, acceptance, and belonging.

For decades, the Actor ran the show.

He performed brilliantly.

He achieved success.

He built an empire.

But he also kept the Director imprisoned—disconnected from true healing, true intimacy, true life.

---

## The Three Covenants

Paul helped me identify three devastating covenants I had made in moments of pain:

### Covenant 1: Love Equals Suffering
*Made at age fifteen after my first heartbreak.*

I vowed to never let myself fall in love again. To never let myself suffer like that again. This covenant blocked my capacity to receive unconditional love—from others, from myself, and from God.

### Covenant 2: I Will Be My Own God
*Made in the aftermath of heartbreak and abuse.*

In my pain and confusion, I rejected God and crowned myself as god of my own life. This covenant led to decades of rebellion, self-reliance, and spiritual disconnection.

### Covenant 3: Just Watch Me
*Made at age sixteen when I left home.*

Standing at the door, looking at my devastated father, I vowed to become successful no matter what—to prove I could make it without God and without family. This covenant drove my obsession with achievement and made Mammon my functional god.

---

## Seeing the Roots

Session by session, Paul and I traced the roots of my symptoms:

**Depression** was not a chemical imbalance to be medicated. It was the accumulated weight of suppressed grief, shame, and unprocessed trauma.

**Hypomania** was not simply bipolar cycling. It was a survival mechanism—the actor going into overdrive to escape the unbearable pain of stillness.

**Addiction** was not a moral failing or brain disease alone. It was a desperate attempt to self-medicate unbearable inner anguish.

**Insomnia** was not a sleep disorder. It was a nervous system that never learned safety, hypervigilant against threats that no longer existed.

**Anxiety** was not generalized worry. It was the terror of the wounded child who learned the world is dangerous and love is conditional.

---

## The Abuse

For the first time in my life, I began to fully face the sexual abuse I experienced from age eight to eleven.

The abuse happened within my church community.

By someone I trusted.

It fractured my sense of self.

It taught me that my body was not my own.

It planted seeds of shame that took root for decades.

For years, I had minimized it.

Rationalized it.

Buried it.

Now, with Paul's guidance, I began to grieve it.

To honor the pain of that little boy.

To release what had been stored in my body for over thirty-five years.

---

## The Father Wound

We also explored my relationship with my father.

The love that was real.

The pressure that was painful.

The ultimatum that felt like rejection.

The covenant that was birthed in that moment.

I saw how my entire drive for success was, at its core, an attempt to earn my father's approval—even though he had always loved me unconditionally.

The wound was not what my father did.

The wound was what I interpreted his actions to mean.

And that interpretation had governed my life.

---

## The Mother Wound

Interestingly, my mother remained a sacred pause in the therapy.

Something we touched gently but did not fully enter.

There was pain there too—different from my father, but present.

The overprotection that came from love but created fear.

The religious strictness that taught rules over relationship.

The sacrifice she made that I later felt as pressure.

This wound would await future healing.

---

## Preparing for Ibogaine

As 2024 progressed into 2025, Paul and I discussed Ibogaine.

He had seen it help clients access what years of talk therapy could not.

He believed it could accelerate my healing.

But he also cautioned me:

*"Ibogaine is not magic. It's a tool. What matters is what you do with what it reveals."*

We agreed that the therapeutic work we had done was essential preparation.

I was not going to Ibogaine as an escape.

I was going with eyes open, heart surrendered, and a foundation of inner work already laid.

---

## The Decision

After much prayer, research, and discussion with Nancy, I made the decision.

I would go to **Transcend Clinic** in Cancun, Mexico.

I would undergo the **Ibogaine protocol**.

I would face whatever God had to show me.

I would trust that this was the path.

Nancy supported me, though she had her fears.

What if something went wrong?

What if I came back worse?

What if this was just another failed attempt?

I looked into her eyes and said:

*"I have tried everything else. I believe God is leading me to this. I have to go."*

She nodded.

She prayed with me.

She released me to the journey.

---

## Final Preparations

In the weeks leading up to my departure, I completed a series of medical tests.

I adjusted my diet.

I entered a period of mental and spiritual preparation.

I wrote letters to Nancy and the children—just in case.

I made peace with my life as it was.

And I surrendered the outcome to God.

Whatever happened in that clinic, I was ready.

Ready to live.

Ready to die to the old self.

Ready to be reborn.
