## The Ideal Way

---

*Building an Empire While Running on Empty*

---

It wasn't enough to succeed at Ideal Protein.

I needed to prove myself in another arena. To build something of my own. To demonstrate that the skills I was deploying for someone else could work for me.

So I co-founded The Ideal Way.

Another venture. Another platform. Another opportunity to perform excellence for an audience that needed to see it.

---

## The Concept

The Ideal Way was a coaching and consulting company focused on personal development and leadership.

The framework integrated everything I had learned:

- The twelve-step principles from recovery
- The personal development teachings from mentors along the way
- The hard-won lessons from my failures and successes

I would help people transform their lives across four dimensions:

**Body** – Physical health and vitality
**Being** – Identity, mindset, and emotional mastery
**Balance** – Relationships, family, and life integration
**Business** – Entrepreneurship, leadership, and wealth creation

It was a beautiful framework. Comprehensive. Holistic. Addressing the full spectrum of human flourishing.

I believed in it completely.

And I was completely unqualified to teach it.

## The Irony

Here was a man teaching transformation who had not been transformed.

A man teaching emotional mastery who couldn't access his own emotions.

A man teaching relationship balance who kept his wife at arm's length.

A man teaching integration who remained fundamentally fragmented.

The irony was invisible to everyone—including me.

I had the language. I could speak about vulnerability without being vulnerable. I could describe presence without being present. I could articulate what wholeness looked like without having experienced it.

This is the danger of the personal development industry: you can become very good at performing wisdom without possessing it.

I was excellent at performance.

## The Clients

I worked with executives, entrepreneurs, and professionals.

People at the top of their fields who felt empty. People who had achieved everything and wondered what came next. People who sensed, in the quiet moments, that something fundamental was missing.

In other words: people exactly like me.

I saw myself in every client who walked through the door.

And because I recognized the wound, I could speak to it. I could name what they were experiencing. I could provide frameworks and strategies and accountability structures that genuinely helped.

The coaching worked. People's lives improved. The testimonials were real.

But here's what I know now:

I was leading people to a destination I hadn't reached.

I was giving them a map to a place I had never been.

The blind leading the sighted—telling them where to walk without ever having walked there myself.

---

## The Running

The Ideal Way was, among other things, a very effective way to avoid myself.

Every hour spent coaching a client was an hour not spent in silence with my own thoughts.

Every workshop facilitated was energy directed outward instead of inward.

Every framework I taught was another layer of intellectual understanding that substituted for lived experience.

I was running. Still running. Just with better language for why I was running.

The *just watch me* covenant had found a new expression: become so busy helping others that you never have to face yourself.

It worked. For years, it worked.

Until it didn't.

---

## The Performing Helper

There is a pattern I see now in recovery and personal development communities:

Wounded people become helpers before they've healed.

We dive into service—sponsoring others in AA, coaching clients, leading workshops—because helping feels better than hurting. Because focusing on someone else's problems is easier than facing our own.

And the helping is genuine. Real benefit flows to those we serve.

But the helper remains unchanged.

I was a performing helper. The performance was convincing because it was partially sincere. I genuinely cared about my clients. I genuinely wanted them to succeed.

But beneath the care was an engine that had nothing to do with them: my own desperate need to prove my worth, to justify my existence, to matter.

Every success story was really about me.

Every transformation I facilitated was evidence for my own value.

Every client who improved was another vote in the election I was constantly running—the election where I hoped, finally, to prove that I was okay.

---

## What Clients Received

Let me be fair to what I offered during those years:

The frameworks were legitimate. The tools helped people. The accountability made a difference.

Clients improved their health. Built better businesses. Strengthened their relationships.

I wasn't a fraud in the sense of giving useless advice. The advice was often good.

What I couldn't give was the thing I didn't have: the transmission of genuine transformation.

You've probably met people who radiate peace. Who exude a presence that isn't about what they say but about what they are. Who change the temperature of a room simply by entering it.

I was not that person.

I was the salesman of peace, not its possessor.

And clients could get the product—the strategies, the frameworks, the behavior changes—without getting the transmission.

Because I didn't have it to give.

---

## The Exhaustion

Helping from woundedness is exhausting.

When you're giving from a deficit, every session drains you. You have nothing to replenish what you've spent, because you've been running on empty to begin with.

By the time the corporate position ended—by the time February 26, 2018 arrived—I was running on fumes.

The coaching practice.
The corporate role.
The family.
The recovery meetings.
The constant performance on all fronts.

Something had to give.

And it did.

## What I Know Now

Looking back at The Ideal Way with transformed eyes, I see several truths:

**The desire to help was genuine.**

I'm not dismissing the sincerity. The impulse to take what I had learned—even partial learning—and share it with others came from a real place.

**But the timing was wrong.**

I was teaching before I had fully learned. Sharing transformation before I had been transformed. Leading others to a destination I had only read about in books.

**Helping can be hiding.**

Service is sometimes sacred. And sometimes service is a socially acceptable way to avoid the internal work.

**You can only take people as far as you've gone.**

This is the hard truth. Your ceiling becomes their ceiling. Your blind spots become their obstacles. Your unhealed wounds subtly infect every interaction.

**Real transformation creates capacity.**

After the genuine healing—after the ibogaine, after the covenants burned, after the resurrection—I found I could serve without depleting. Give without running empty. Hold space without losing myself.

The difference wasn't in the techniques. It was in the source.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you're in a helping profession—therapist, coach, minister, sponsor—I want to honor the work you do.*

*I also want to gently ask:*

*Are you helping from overflow or from deficit?*

*Is your service an expression of wholeness or an escape from brokenness?*

*Have you gone where you're taking others, or are you running in the same direction and calling it leadership?*

*There's no shame in the honest answer. Many of us entered helping professions precisely because we needed help. We found frameworks that seemed to work and wanted to share them. We discovered language for our pain and thought that language would work for others too.*

*But at some point, if you want to truly serve, you have to face your own wound.*

*You have to go beyond the frameworks into the territory of genuine transformation.*

*You have to become, not just teach.*

*The world doesn't need more performing helpers.*

*It needs people who have walked through the fire and can now hold a lantern for others.*

*That's a different kind of guide entirely.*
