# Chapter Three
## Nancy's Faith

---

*2008*

---

After everything—the almost-dying, the three rehabs, the jail cell, the snowstorm, the years of betrayal and chaos and heartbreak—I asked Nancy to marry me.

And she said yes.

---

## The Question

Some people will not understand this.

They will ask: Why would she stay? Why would she want to formalize a bond with a man who had caused so much damage? Why would she tie her life to someone whose track record was catastrophe?

I asked myself these questions. I still ask them sometimes.

The answer is not logical. It cannot be explained through the calculus of relationships, the weighing of pros and cons, the reasonable assessment of future risk.

The answer is faith.

Nancy had faith in something she could see that I couldn't see—the man I could become. She had faith in a sacred contract she believed God had established before either of us was born. She had faith that her calling was to love me into awakening, no matter how long it took.

When I got on my knee with a ring in my hand, I was asking her to bet on a horse that had never finished a race.

She placed the bet anyway.

---

## The Ceremony

We married in a small ceremony. Close family. Close friends. Nothing extravagant.

Nancy had never needed extravagance. She had survived on nothing. She had left home at fifteen and built a life from scratch. She knew the difference between show and substance.

What mattered was the vow.

I stood before God—the God I was slowly, reluctantly returning to—and made a promise to this woman who had already given me more than I could ever repay.

I vowed to honor her.
To protect her.
To love her.
To stay.

And silently, beneath the spoken vows, I made another promise:

I would stay sober. For her. For us. For whatever family we would build.

I meant it.

I meant all of it.

I just didn't know yet how much the keeping of those vows would require.

## What Nancy Carried

I want you to understand what Nancy had already endured by the time she said "I do."

She had watched me destroy myself for years. Held me through withdrawals. Cleaned up after psychotic episodes. Received phone calls from jails and hospitals. Searched for me in a snowstorm, not knowing if she would find a body.

She had been betrayed—repeatedly, flagrantly—and had chosen to stay anyway.

She had sacrificed her own wellbeing to support my chaos. Gone back to work she hated to fund my lifestyle. Put her dreams on hold while I chased mine into the ground.

And through all of it, she had prayed. Every morning. Every night. On her knees by the bed we shared, speaking to a God I had rejected, asking for my salvation.

When she married me, she was not marrying the man I had been. She was marrying the man she believed I could become.

That is an act of almost irrational faith.

And it carried us through the next decade.

## The Early Years

The first years of marriage were not easy.

I was learning to live sober—really live, not just not-drink. Every emotion I had numbed for years came flooding back. Anger. Grief. Fear. The whole spectrum that alcohol had suppressed.

Nancy received all of it.

She didn't receive it passively. She was never passive. She confronted me when I was wrong. She refused to enable the patterns that had almost killed me. She held me accountable while also holding me up.

During those years, I had a few short relapses.

Each one was devastating. The shame that followed was almost worse than the drinking itself. The look in Nancy's eyes—not judgment, but grief—cut deeper than any accusation could have.

But each time, I got back up.

I returned to meetings. Called my sponsor. Surrendered again.

And Nancy was there. Not waiting with open arms as if nothing had happened—that would have been enabling. But waiting with the conviction that this relapse, like the others, was not the end of the story.

Her faith never wavered.

Even when mine did.

## The Container She Created

One thing I didn't understand until years later: Nancy created the container in which my recovery could happen.

What do I mean by container?

Recovery requires stability. You need a safe place to land when the world shakes. You need someone who believes in you when you've forgotten how to believe in yourself. You need a home that is actually home—not just a house, but a place of genuine belonging.

Nancy created that.

She managed the household while I attended meetings. She held the family together while I worked my steps. She created normalcy—meals, routines, the small structures of daily life—so that I could focus on not drinking.

This is invisible labor. It's the work that doesn't get celebrated at meetings. It's the sacrifice that doesn't receive chips or applause.

But it's essential.

I couldn't have stayed sober without the container Nancy created. I would have had nowhere to practice new behaviors. No safe space to fall apart and reassemble.

She was the scaffolding while I was under construction.

## What I Couldn't Give

Here is the part that shames me to write:

During those early years—and for many years after—I could not fully give Nancy what she deserved.

I was sober. I was present. I was trying.

But the covenant was still running.

*Love equals suffering.*

Every time intimacy deepened, something in me pulled back. Every time vulnerability was required, I performed instead of revealed. Every time Nancy needed me to truly see her—to feel with her, not just provide for her—I couldn't access that capacity.

The abuse had stolen it. The years of self-protection had buried it. The pattern was set: get close, but not too close. Give, but keep something in reserve. Love, but never completely.

I didn't know I was doing this. I thought I was being a good husband. I was checking the boxes: providing financially, staying sober, being physically present.

But Nancy needed more than a checked box. She needed a partner who could meet her in the depths.

And I wasn't capable of that. Not yet.

The man who would weep at her suffering—who would finally feel what she felt, who would break open in authentic empathy—that man was still years away.

What she got was a performer.

A good performer. An improving performer. But a performer nonetheless.

## Her Prayers Continued

Every morning, Nancy got on her knees.

Every night, the same.

She prayed for me. For our marriage. For the family we were building. For the breakthrough she believed was coming.

I would watch her sometimes—pretending to be asleep—and feel two things simultaneously:

Guilt, that I wasn't the man she was praying for me to become.

And hope, that her prayers might actually work.

The faith she carried was not naive. She knew exactly what she had married. She had no illusions about my brokenness.

But she also knew something else: that God was real, that transformation was possible, and that her role was to hold the vision until I could hold it myself.

This is the definition of intercessory love. Standing in the gap. Believing on behalf of someone who cannot yet believe for themselves.

Nancy did this for decades.

She is still doing it now.

## What I See Now

Looking back at our wedding day with the eyes of someone fully transformed, I understand what happened:

Nancy made a covenant.

Not just with me—with God. She covenanted to love me through whatever was coming. To stay when leaving would have been reasonable. To believe when belief was ridiculous.

This covenant was the mirror of my covenants.

Where mine were formed in pain and led to destruction, hers was formed in faith and led to life.

Where mine said *love equals suffering*, hers said *love is worth suffering for.*

Where mine said *I am my own god*, hers said *God is God, and His plans are bigger than my pain.*

She didn't just love me.

She out-covenanted me.

She made a promise in the spiritual realm that was stronger than the promises I had made in my brokenness.

And over time—through years of her faithfulness—her covenant would begin to break mine.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Is there a Nancy in your life?*

*Someone who has loved you beyond reason? Who has stayed when they should have left? Who sees something in you that you cannot see in yourself?*

*If there is, I want you to consider something:*

*Their love is not just affection. It's not just loyalty. It might be something closer to calling.*

*Some people are assigned to us. Sent to hold a vision when we've lost ours. Sent to believe on our behalf. Sent to love us—not into enabling, not into accepting abuse—but into awakening.*

*If you have such a person, you are carrying a sacred responsibility.*

*Their faith in you is not infinite fuel you can burn without replenishment. Their love is not a license to remain unchanged.*

*Their sacrifice is a gift. And gifts come with an implied question: What will you do with this?*

*You can squander it. You can take it for granted. You can consume their devotion without ever becoming the person they believe you can be.*

*Or you can honor it.*

*You can let their faith become fuel for your transformation. You can use their belief as a bridge until you build your own. You can become, finally, the person they've been praying you would become.*

*Nancy's faith carried me for years.*

*But faith was never meant to be one-sided forever.*

*At some point, I had to take up my own burden. Walk on my own legs. Become the man she married, not just the man she believed in.*

*That work is yours to do.*

*No one can do it for you.*
