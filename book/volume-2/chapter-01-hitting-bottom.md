# Chapter One
## Hitting Bottom

---

*June 2007 - Winter 2008*

---

Nancy was supposed to land at 9 PM.

I was supposed to pick her up.

I never made it.

When she finally arrived at the mansion—confused, worried, having taken a taxi from the airport—she found something that would haunt her for years.

She found me almost dead.

---

## The State of Destruction

I don't know exactly what I looked like that night. I was beyond the capacity for self-observation. But I know what Nancy saw:

A man who had been drinking forty to sixty ounces of hard liquor daily for weeks. A body that had stopped processing food. Eyes that had lost any connection to the person behind them. A shell inhabited by something that no longer resembled the man she had promised to love into awakening.

She thought she was looking at a corpse.

For a moment, she believed she was too late.

Then I moved. Or breathed. Or gave some sign that the thread between me and life hadn't completely snapped.

And Nancy did what Nancy always did: she fought for me when I couldn't fight for myself.

---

## The Intervention

She called everyone she could think of.

Family. Friends. Anyone from my past who might have wisdom about what to do with a man who was killing himself in real-time.

I had a friend from the gym—someone who had been sober for many years. He came to the mansion.

He looked at me with eyes that recognized what they were seeing. Not with judgment. Not with fear. With the understanding of someone who had been where I was.

"I came from a similar place," he said. "If you don't stop drinking, you will die."

It was not a threat. It was not an ultimatum. It was a statement of fact, delivered with the calm certainty of someone who understood the mathematics of addiction.

He told me about Alcoholics Anonymous. About meetings filled with people just like me—people who had found a way out of the darkness.

For the first time in months, I felt something other than despair.

I felt hope.

Faint. Flickering. But real.

## First Rehab: The False Start

My mother found a rehabilitation center in Montreal.

Days later, Nancy and my sister drove me there. I was too broken to drive myself. Too broken for much of anything except surrender.

Sixteen days.

That's how long I stayed. Sixteen days of detox, of slowly returning to something resembling human, of believing that the worst was behind me.

I came out feeling better. Physically, at least. The shaking had stopped. I could eat again. I could think in complete sentences.

I convinced myself I was cured.

My brother flew in from New York. We picked up Nancy and flew to Mexico. The plan was rest, reflection, ocean air to heal the soul.

The plan was foolish.

Within hours of landing, we were celebrating. Celebration meant drinks. Drinks meant the disease waking up and stretching its arms. The week that followed was a savage blur of everything I had supposedly left behind.

We returned home worse than before.

I had spent a fortune—rehab plus vacation—and had nothing to show for it except deeper shame and a shorter runway before the money ran out completely.

This was my first lesson in a truth I would learn again and again:

**You cannot vacation your way out of addiction. You cannot spend money to escape it. You cannot change locations and expect the disease to respect the new geography.**

The disease travels with you. It lives in your nervous system, your neural pathways, your soul. Until you address it at that level, it will find you wherever you go.

---

## The High-Functioning Alcoholic

I continued drinking for the next six months.

But something shifted in how I approached it. The complete breakdown, the almost-dying—that had scared me enough to change my tactics.

I became a high-functioning alcoholic.

During the day, I ran the businesses. I made calls. I had meetings. I performed competence with the same skill I had always used to perform whatever was required.

In the evening, I drank. Steadily. Consistently. Enough to quiet the demons but not enough to collapse entirely.

I lied to myself constantly. *The problem was the drugs, not the alcohol. If I just avoid cocaine, I'll be fine. Alcohol is manageable. Alcohol is socially acceptable. Alcohol is not the problem.*

The devil laughed at my denial.

Things only got worse. My behavior under the influence became savage. I hurt Nancy in ways I had never done before. I called people to exact vengeance on old enemies. I woke up in strange places with no memory of how I had arrived.

And then, one morning, I woke up in jail.

---

## The Jail Cell

An officer told me I had been arrested for assaulting a female police officer.

I had no memory of it. None. The hours between my last conscious moment and waking in that cell were a complete void.

I pleaded with the officer. "I'm not the kind of guy who would hurt a woman. Please check on her. Is she okay?"

He left. Came back.

"She's filed her report. She says you were extremely intoxicated and became violent. When she approached to calm you down, she tripped, fell, and injured her shoulder."

She claimed I had pushed her. It was her word against mine.

But I was a registered criminal. Heavily intoxicated. With zero memory of the night in question.

Who would believe me?

Fortunately, there was a video camera.

The footage showed the truth: I had been aggressive, yes. Dangerously drunk, yes. But I had not touched her. She had tripped on her own.

The assault charges were eventually dropped after my attorney intervened. I was still charged with public intoxication, held for a few more hours, then released.

But the wake-up call had been delivered. My life had become the kind of life where waking up in jail and not remembering why was possible.

What kind of man had I become?

---

## The Escape to Nowhere

My response to this crisis was predictable: I ran.

I flew to the Dominican Republic. Alone. The plan was to drink by the ocean, feel sorry for myself, and rest.

What I was really doing was trying to outrun the consequences of my choices. Trying to find a place where the shame couldn't reach me.

It didn't work.

Two weeks later, I returned home in even worse condition than before.

The disease had followed me to paradise.

It would follow me anywhere.

---

## The Snowstorm

It was deep winter in Canada. The mansion was surrounded by forest.

One night, after another session of drinking, I walked out the back door.

I don't know why. There was no plan. Just a compulsion to move, to escape, to go somewhere other than where I was.

I walked into the woods. Into a snowstorm.

Hours passed. I lost all sense of direction. The darkness was total. The cold was becoming dangerous.

I realized, with a strange calm, that I might die out here.

Part of me welcomed it.

I was exhausted. Not just from walking—from everything. From the years of fighting a battle I kept losing. From the shame that never lifted. From the certainty that I would never be free.

I sat down in the snow. Ready to let the cold take me.

And then I heard a voice.

---

## The Voice

It was not audible in the ordinary sense. It was not thunder from heaven or an angel appearing in glory.

It was a voice inside me. Clear. Calm. Authoritative.

*Stand up.*

Something in me responded before my mind could argue. I stood.

Through the trees and the snow, I saw a light.

Distant. Faint. But real.

I walked toward it.

---

## The Stranger's House

I knocked on the door.

A man opened it. Looked at me—covered in snow, half-frozen, barely coherent.

"You look like death," he said.

He brought me inside. Sat me by the fireplace. Gave me hot chocolate. His wife called the mansion.

Nancy and the others had been searching for me in a panic. They came to get me.

In the car, something inside me shifted.

What had just happened?

How had I heard that voice? How had I seen that light at the exact moment I was ready to die?

Was it God?

I wasn't ready to accept Him back into my life. Too much anger. Too much rebellion. Too many years of being my own god.

But something had intervened. Something had saved me when I couldn't save myself.

That something would not leave me alone.

---

## Second Rehab: The Hope That Broke

After many more conversations with friends in sobriety, I made a decision.

I would enter a real rehabilitation program. Not sixteen days—thirty days. With counseling, step work, accountability, the full treatment.

The center was in Alberta. Across the country. Far from everything I knew.

I spent thirty days there.

For the first time, I truly believed there was hope for me.

I participated in everything. Group therapy. Individual sessions. Writing exercises. Spiritual reflection. I followed every recommendation. I believed this time would be different.

I returned to Toronto ready to restart my life.

Everything was on track. Meetings every day. A new sponsor. Working the twelve steps with genuine commitment.

After sixty days of sobriety, I attended my sponsor's funeral.

---

## The Death That Broke Me

He had relapsed. After years of sobriety. After being the man I called when the cravings hit. After being my proof that recovery was possible.

He had relapsed and overdosed and died.

I stood at his grave and felt something collapse inside me.

If he couldn't make it, how could I?

If someone with that many years, that much wisdom, that strong a foundation could fall—what chance did I have?

The questions were poison. They fed the part of me that wanted to quit trying. That wanted to return to the bottle and stop pretending I could escape.

I relapsed.

For two weeks, I drank with the desperation of someone who had given up.

Then something pulled me back. Nancy. My parents. The voice in the snowstorm that refused to let me die.

I went back to rehab.

---

## Third Rehab: The One That Stuck

This time, the center was in the Laurentians.

Another thirty days. Another excavation of my soul.

But something was different this time. The previous attempts had softened the ground. The sponsor's death had shown me what was at stake. The voice in the snowstorm had planted a seed of something I couldn't name.

When I returned home this time, I found a sponsor with solid sobriety. A man who became a mentor and father figure. A man who would walk with me through the years ahead.

My mother and father came to visit.

My business partners, with my consent, had sold the remaining businesses and exited me from everything. The empire I had built was gone. The money was nearly depleted.

I had lost almost everything material.

But for the first time in years, I felt clarity.

The towers had fallen. The sand had shifted. There was nothing left to prove.

Maybe that was the point.

Maybe I had to lose everything to discover that everything I had built was nothing worth keeping.

I was ready to rebuild. From the ground up. On a different foundation.

Or so I believed.

---

## What I Didn't Know

Looking back, I can see what I couldn't see then:

The three rehabs had saved my life. The rooms of AA would give me a framework for living sober. The sponsor who didn't die would provide accountability and wisdom.

But these were tools for managing the disease. They were not cures for the wound beneath it.

The abuse was still buried. The covenants still operated. The little boy who had been fractured was still hiding in the basement of my soul, waiting to be seen.

I was about to build an impressive new life on the same fractured foundation. Eight years of sobriety. A beautiful marriage. Two children. Corporate success beyond my wildest dreams.

And it would all collapse.

Because recovery without transformation is reformation without resurrection.

Because you can be sober and still be sick.

Because the wound that drove the addiction was never the addiction itself.

But I didn't know that yet.

I only knew that I was alive when I should have been dead. That I had been given another chance. That somehow, against all odds, I was still here.

And for the first time in years, that felt like something to be grateful for.

*Dear Traveler,*

*How many times have you hit bottom?*

*Not the dramatic, Hollywood bottom—the slow, grinding realization that what you're doing isn't working. The accumulation of consequences that finally becomes too heavy to ignore.*

*Here's what I've learned about bottoms: they're not always the same for everyone. Some people touch the floor once and bounce back. Others keep finding new floors beneath the floor they thought was lowest.*

*The question is not how low you've gone. The question is what happens when you get there.*

*Do you stay down?*

*Do you dig deeper?*

*Or do you finally surrender?*

*Surrender doesn't mean giving up. It means giving over. Acknowledging that whatever you've been trying—the self-reliance, the willpower, the geographic cures and promises to do better—isn't enough.*

*I had to almost die in a snowstorm before I heard the voice that saved me.*

*What will it take for you?*

*Maybe you're there now. Maybe you're reading this at the bottom you never thought you'd reach.*

*Here's what I want you to know:*

*The bottom is not the end. It's the beginning. It's the place where everything that doesn't work finally stops working, and something new becomes possible.*

*Stand up.*

*Look for the light.*

*It's there.*
