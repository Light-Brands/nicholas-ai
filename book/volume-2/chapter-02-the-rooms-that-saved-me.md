# Chapter Two
## The Rooms That Saved Me

---

*The Framework of Recovery*

---

The first meeting I walked into smelled like bad coffee and honesty.

Fluorescent lights. Folding chairs arranged in a circle. Strangers who looked at me with recognition, not judgment. A banner on the wall with words that would become my lifeline:

*One day at a time.*

I had been to a few meetings before—during the stretches between relapses, during the half-hearted attempts at sobriety that never stuck. But this time was different. This time, I walked in with nothing left to prove.

The empire was gone. The money was gone. The persona I had constructed was in ruins.

All I had was the desperate hope that these people knew something I didn't.

## The Rooms

Alcoholics Anonymous has been helping people get sober since 1935.

Ninety years of accumulated wisdom. Millions of lives saved. A program so effective that it has been adapted for every addiction imaginable—drugs, gambling, food, sex, codependency.

When I entered the rooms, I didn't care about the history. I cared about survival.

And what I found surprised me.

I found people who had lived versions of my story. Executives who had lost everything. Parents who had destroyed their families. Artists whose gifts had been drowned in bottles. People from every walk of life, united by one thing:

They had been exactly where I was. And somehow, they had found a way out.

This was the power of the rooms. Not the steps. Not the literature. Not the sponsors or the slogans or the chips marking months and years of sobriety.

The power was in the recognition.

*I am not alone.*

*I am not uniquely broken.*

*Others have walked this road and survived.*

For someone who had spent decades constructing walls of performance and pretense, this was revolutionary. Here, in these fluorescent-lit rooms, I could finally stop pretending.

## The Twelve Steps

The program of Alcoholics Anonymous is built on twelve steps.

I won't reproduce them all here—they're freely available to anyone who seeks them. But I want to describe what working them felt like, because the steps became the framework of my recovery.

**Steps One through Three** were about surrender.

Admitting that I was powerless over alcohol. That my life had become unmanageable. That I needed a power greater than myself to restore me to sanity.

This was hard for a man who had spent his life declaring *I am my own god*. Hard for someone whose core covenant was *just watch me*—I will succeed on my own terms, by my own power.

But the evidence was undeniable. My way had led to three rehabs, a jail cell, and almost dying in a snowstorm. My way was not working.

I surrendered. Not perfectly. Not completely. But enough to open a door.

**Steps Four and Five** were about honesty.

A searching and fearless moral inventory. A confession to God, to myself, and to another human being of the exact nature of my wrongs.

This was excavation. Writing down every resentment, every fear, every harm I had caused. Sitting with my sponsor and reading it aloud, watching his face for judgment that never came.

What I discovered was that I was not a monster. I was a wounded man who had done monstrous things. And there was a difference.

**Steps Six and Seven** were about transformation.

Being entirely ready to have God remove my defects of character. Humbly asking Him to do so.

This was where the steps began to fail me—though I wouldn't recognize it for years.

I prayed for the removal of my defects. And some patterns did shift. The drinking stopped. The chaos calmed. But the deepest wounds—the ones I couldn't name—remained untouched.

**Steps Eight and Nine** were about repair.

Making a list of all persons I had harmed. Making direct amends wherever possible.

This was the work of facing the wreckage. Sitting with Nancy and apologizing for things I had done. Calling family members I had hurt. Writing letters to people I had wronged.

Some amends were received with grace. Others were rejected. A few couldn't be made at all—the people were gone, or the harm was too great.

But the act of trying changed me. It moved me from victim to actor. From passive sufferer to active participant in my own healing.

**Steps Ten through Twelve** were about maintenance.

Continuing to take personal inventory. Seeking through prayer and meditation to improve conscious contact with God. Carrying the message to others.

This is where I would live for the next eight years. Doing the daily work. Attending meetings. Sponsoring other men. Believing that this was enough.

It wasn't.

## What the Rooms Gave Me

I want to be absolutely clear about something:

AA saved my life.

Without the rooms, I would be dead. Without the structure, the accountability, the fellowship of others who understood—I would have relapsed into oblivion.

The twelve steps gave me:

- **Language.** Words for what I was experiencing. Concepts like "powerlessness" and "surrender" and "making amends" that helped me navigate a world I had been fumbling through.

- **Community.** A tribe of people who knew me at my worst and accepted me anyway. Men who would answer my calls at 2 AM when the cravings hit.

- **Framework.** A system for living that didn't depend on willpower alone. A structure that held me when I couldn't hold myself.

- **Purpose.** The ability to help others. To take what I had learned and pass it on. To sponsor men who were where I had been.

These gifts were genuine. They were transformative. They kept me alive.

But they were not complete.

## What the Rooms Couldn't Give Me

The twelve steps are a program of behavior modification and spiritual connection.

They address what you do and who you trust. They provide tools for managing addiction day by day, relationship by relationship, crisis by crisis.

What they do not do—what they were never designed to do—is heal the wound that caused the addiction in the first place.

I could work a flawless program. Attend every meeting. Call my sponsor daily. Complete every step with thoroughness and sincerity.

And still carry a buried trauma that I couldn't name.

And still operate under covenants formed in childhood that I couldn't see.

And still perform wholeness while fracturing within.

The rooms gave me sobriety. But sobriety is not healing. It is the absence of substance use. It is a necessary condition for healing, but it is not healing itself.

I was sober. But the little boy who had been abused was still frozen in time.

I was sober. But the covenant *love equals suffering* was still running every relationship.

I was sober. But the performance—the Actor, as my therapist would later name it—was still running the show.

The rooms saved my life. But they could not give me my life back.

That would require something more.

## My Sponsor

His name doesn't matter. What matters is what he represented: a man who had done what I needed to do. Who had been where I was and had found a way to something better.

He became my sponsor after the third rehab. The first sponsor had died. The second had helped me return to the rooms after that death. But this man—this became my anchor.

We met for coffee. We talked on the phone. We worked through the steps together, slowly and thoroughly.

He was honest in a way that uncomfortable. He didn't let me get away with my usual performances. When I tried to intellectualize my way through an honest confession, he stopped me.

"Nicholas, you're telling me a story. I need to hear what actually happened."

That was his gift: seeing through the performance. Calling forth the truth beneath the prepared narrative.

He also modeled what sober living could look like. He had a family. He had peace. He laughed easily. He didn't seem to be white-knuckling his way through each day.

He seemed actually free.

I wanted what he had. And I was willing to do whatever he suggested to get it.

## The Illusion of Arrival

The danger of working a good program is that you can start to believe you've arrived.

After a year of sobriety, I felt stable. After two years, I felt strong. After five years, I started feeling like I had this figured out.

The meetings became routine. The steps became familiar. The language of recovery rolled off my tongue with practiced ease.

And somewhere in that familiarity, I stopped digging deeper.

I maintained the behaviors of recovery without continuing the internal work. I checked the boxes without examining what was behind them.

This is what many people in long-term recovery experience. The urgency of early sobriety fades. The daily practices become habits rather than lifelines. The program that once saved your life becomes the thing you do on Thursday nights.

You're still sober. But you're not still growing.

And if you're not growing, the wound beneath the addiction starts to send out new shoots. New manifestations of the same old pain.

For me, those manifestations were workaholism, perfectionism, and the relentless drive to achieve.

I wasn't drinking anymore. But I was still running from the same demons.

I had just found a more socially acceptable way to do it.

## Service as Hiding

One of the beautiful aspects of AA is the emphasis on service.

We help others. We share our stories. We sponsor newcomers. We set up chairs and make coffee and chair meetings.

Service became a central part of my recovery. I sponsored men. I shared at meetings. I became someone that others looked to for guidance.

And I loved it.

Not just because it helped—which it did. But because it gave me a new stage to perform on.

The same skills I had used in nightclubs and business—the charm, the charisma, the ability to make people feel seen—transferred perfectly to recovery meetings. I could captivate a room with my story. I could make a struggling newcomer feel like the most important person in the world.

The performance continued. It just changed costumes.

I'm not saying my service wasn't genuine. Much of it was. The desire to help was real. The compassion I felt for others in early recovery was authentic.

But intertwined with the genuine was the familiar: the need to be seen, to be validated, to prove my worth through performance.

I was still running on the *just watch me* covenant. I just found a new venue.

## What I Know Now

Looking back at those years in the rooms with the clarity of complete transformation, I see what I couldn't see then:

**The rooms were the beginning, not the end.**

They stabilized me. Gave me a foundation. Created the conditions in which deeper healing could eventually occur.

**But deeper healing required more than behavioral change.**

It required facing the wounds I didn't know I carried. Breaking covenants I didn't know I had made. Dying to a self I didn't know was false.

**The steps point beyond themselves.**

The eleventh step speaks of "conscious contact with God as we understood Him." The twelfth speaks of a "spiritual awakening."

These are not destinations the steps guarantee. They are invitations the steps issue.

The steps brought me to the door. But walking through required something the steps alone couldn't provide.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you're in recovery—whether from substances, behaviors, or patterns of destruction—I honor your journey.*

*The rooms, whatever rooms you've found, are sacred ground. The fellowship of others who understand is irreplaceable. The daily practices that keep you sober are not small things—they are the foundation on which everything else can be built.*

*But I also want to gently challenge you:*

*Is sobriety your destination or your doorway?*

*Have you stopped digging, thinking you've reached the bottom of the wound?*

*Are you maintaining recovery without pursuing transformation?*

*There is more. There is always more.*

*The behaviors you've changed are important. The chemicals you no longer use are important. But beneath the behavior, beneath the chemicals, there is a wound that may still be bleeding.*

*Don't be afraid to look. Don't settle for sobriety when wholeness is possible.*

*The rooms are not the garden. They are a rest stop on the way home.*

*Keep walking.*
