# Chapter Eight
## February 26, 2018

---

*The Day the Towers Fell*

---

The meeting was scheduled for 2 PM.

Just another calendar block in a day full of calendar blocks. I walked in expecting to discuss quarterly projections, team restructuring, operational efficiencies.

I walked out with nothing.

---

## The Words

The executive who delivered the news was professional.

The company was restructuring. Positions were being eliminated. My position was one of them.

I heard the words, but they didn't compute. My mind kept trying to process them in a way that made sense, that allowed the world to remain as I had constructed it.

*Restructuring.*

But I was the VP of Sales. I had built this. I had proven myself. I had $7.9 million in stock options.

*Position eliminated.*

But I was Nicholas Courchesne. The one who always landed on his feet. The one who had sworn *just watch me* and then made everyone watch.

*Effective immediately.*

But I had a family. A coaching practice. A recovery community. A life constructed around this identity.

The words kept coming. Severance. Transition. Best wishes.

And then it was over.

I gathered my things.

I walked out of the building.

And I felt the floor disappear beneath my feet.

---

## The Numbers

$7.9 million.

Gone.

Not stolen. Not defrauded. Simply... irrelevant.

Stock options only matter if you're still employed when they vest. If you're terminated, they become worthless paper.

Years of work. Years of sacrifice. Years of travel and performance and grinding toward a financial future.

All of it wiped out in a single conversation.

I sat in my car in the parking garage and looked at the numbers.

Zero.

The VP of Sales was worth $7.9 million yesterday.

The terminated employee was worth zero today.

The same person. Different circumstances. Completely different value.

Is this what worth looked like?

---

## The Identity Crisis

In the hours that followed, something became terrifyingly clear:

I had no idea who I was without the title.

"Nicholas Courchesne, Vice President of Sales at Ideal Protein."

That wasn't just what I did. That was who I was. The identity had fused so completely with the role that removing the role left... nothing.

Just a man sitting in a car, staring at a steering wheel, unable to answer the simplest question:

*Who are you now?*

The covenant *just watch me* had been about performance—about doing and having and achieving. The watching mattered because the achievement mattered. Without the achievement, there was nothing to watch.

I was forty-seven years old, eight years sober, and I had no idea who I was.

---

## The Old Voice Returns

In the silence of that car, voices emerged from the darkness.

Not audible voices. Internal whispers. The same chorus that had tormented me in 2007, now returning with fresh ammunition.

*You're a failure.*

*All that work was for nothing.*

*Nancy would be better off without you.*

*The children deserve a father who can actually provide.*

*Maybe it's time to stop pretending.*

The suicidal ideation—which I thought had been left behind with the drinking—was back.

I wasn't planning anything. I wasn't researching methods. But the desire not to exist, the sense that non-existence would be easier than facing what I now had to face—that was very much present.

The spirit of death knew my address.

And it came knocking again.

---

## The Impossible Phone Call

I had to tell Nancy.

Sitting in that parking garage, I knew I couldn't go home until I had told her. And I couldn't tell her over the phone. But I couldn't move.

Eventually, I called.

"Something happened at work."

Her voice on the other end—concerned, attentive, already bracing for whatever was coming.

"I lost my job. They eliminated my position. The options... everything... it's gone."

Silence.

Then Nancy, with the steadiness that had carried us through everything:

"Come home. We'll figure this out together."

That was all she said. That was all she needed to say.

In that moment, she did not ask about money. Did not panic about the future. Did not make me feel worse than I already felt.

She simply called me home.

---

## The Unraveling

The days that followed blurred together.

I went through the motions—severance negotiations, resume updates, networking calls—but I was hollow.

The performance had stopped. For the first time in decades, there was no stage. No audience. Nothing to prove.

And without the performance, I didn't know how to exist.

I stopped attending meetings as regularly. Stopped calling my sponsor. Stopped doing the things that had kept me sober for eight years.

The recovery foundation that I had assumed was solid turned out to be contingent. It depended on the context. Remove the context, and the foundation wavered.

I didn't drink. Not yet. But the ground was shifting.

---

## The Collapse Had Begun

February 26, 2018 was not the end of the collapse.

It was the beginning.

What followed—detailed in the next volume—would be the worst three years of my life. Worse than the drinking. Worse than the psychosis. Worse than anything I had experienced.

Bipolar diagnosis. Psychiatric medications. Hospitalizations. Relapses that shattered the eight years of sobriety. Voices telling me to end my life.

The collapse that began on February 26, 2018 would not complete itself until August 2025—seven years later—when I lay on a mat in Cancun and heard the words *It is finished.*

But all of that is for Volume Three.

Here, in this volume, we end where we must end:

With the towers falling.

With the identity collapsing.

With the man who had everything discovering that everything he had was nothing.

---

## The Meaning in the Wreckage

Why did this happen?

For years, I would ask that question with bitterness. Why did God allow this? Why was everything I built destroyed? Why did the rug get pulled out just when I thought I had made it?

Now I know the answer:

**Because what I had built could not hold what God wanted to give me.**

The towers were impressive. But they were on sand. The identity was polished. But it was false. The achievement was genuine. But it was covering wounds, not healing them.

Everything had to fall.

Not because I was being punished. But because I was being prepared.

Not because God was cruel. But because God wanted to give me something better.

You cannot build resurrection on unreleased death.

You cannot construct transformation on untransformed foundations.

You cannot receive the garden until you let go of the wilderness.

February 26, 2018 was the beginning of the end.

And the end is always the beginning of something else.

## What This Volume Has Shown

Volume II traced an arc that many people will recognize:

The prodigal gets sober.
The prodigal builds a new life.
The prodigal achieves success.
The prodigal stands on the summit.
And the prodigal discovers that the summit was never the destination.

**Sobriety is not healing.**

You can stop drinking and remain wounded. You can check every box of recovery and still be fundamentally unchanged. You can perform wellness for years while fracturing within.

**Success is not identity.**

You can accumulate millions and have no idea who you are. You can build an empire and be enslaved to the building of it. You can prove everyone wrong and still be asking the wrong question.

**The towers must fall.**

Whatever is built on sand will eventually collapse. This is not tragedy—it is mercy. The collapse creates the opening for something real to be built.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Perhaps you are standing in your own wreckage.*

*Perhaps the job ended, the relationship collapsed, the identity you had constructed fell apart.*

*Perhaps you're looking at the rubble and asking: What now? Who am I? Was any of it real?*

*I don't have easy answers. The walk through the wreckage is brutal. The years that followed February 26, 2018 nearly killed me—more than once, more than figuratively.*

*But I can tell you where the walk eventually leads:*

*To a room in Mexico where you hear "It is finished."*

*To covenants burning before the throne of God.*

*To an identity that cannot be taken because it was never given by circumstances.*

*To a garden that was waiting all along.*

*The collapse is not the end, dear traveler.*

*It is the end of one story.*

*And the beginning of another.*

*A story that is better. Truer. More alive than anything you've experienced.*

*The wreckage is not evidence of God's absence.*

*It is preparation for His arrival.*

*Keep walking.*

*The garden is ahead.*
