# Chapter Four
## Children of Promise

---

*The Stakes Become Infinite*

---

Perla came first.

Then Maverick.

Two souls who would change everything—and nothing.

---

## The First Cry

When my daughter was born, I felt something I had never felt before.

I had experienced love—or what I thought was love—for Nancy. For my parents. For friends and mentors along the way.

But this was different.

Looking at Perla for the first time, I understood that love is not just an emotion. It's a reordering of reality. A fundamental shift in what matters, what you would sacrifice, what you would die for.

This tiny creature, helpless and perfect, had just reorganized my entire universe.

And I was terrified.

---

## The Weight of Inheritance

I held her in the hospital room, and a thought surfaced that I couldn't shake:

*What are you going to pass down?*

I knew about generational patterns. I had seen them in my own family. My grandmother who lost her husband and son to suicide. My father's affairs before his conversion. The wounds that jumped from generation to generation like fire across dry brush.

I had spent years running from my own pain. I had built towers on sand. I had almost died multiple times.

And now this perfect being was looking at me with eyes that trusted completely.

*What are you going to give her?*

The covenant formed unconsciously, as all my covenants did:

I would break the cycle.
I would not pass down my pain.
I would become the father she deserved.

It was a beautiful intention. But intentions are not the same as transformation.

---

## Maverick

When my son was born, the weight doubled.

A daughter and a son. A complete family. Two lives that would be shaped by every decision I made, every pattern I modeled, every moment of presence or absence.

Maverick looked at me with the same trust his sister had. The same assumption that Daddy knew what he was doing. The same innocent faith that the world was safe because Daddy was in it.

I felt like a fraud.

Yes, I was sober. Yes, I was present. Yes, I was trying harder than I had ever tried at anything.

But I knew—somewhere beneath the performance—that I was still broken. That the man these children trusted was still running from wounds he couldn't name. That the father they believed in was still, in some fundamental way, a child himself.

The wounded child healing wounded children.

The fractured trying to build something whole.

---

## The Performance Intensifies

After the children came, the performance reached new heights.

I had even more to prove now. Even more at stake. Even more reason to succeed, to provide, to demonstrate that I had overcome my past.

The *just watch me* covenant found new fuel.

Watch me be the father I never had.
Watch me create the stability I was denied.
Watch me break every pattern that tried to break me.

I worked harder. Built faster. Climbed higher. The corporate success that was coming—Ideal Protein, the VP title, the millions in options—was driven in part by this new motivation.

I had children watching now.

I had to prove I was worthy of their trust.

---

## What They Received

I want to be honest about what my children received during these years.

They received a sober father. That mattered. They never saw me drunk. Never experienced the chaos of active addiction. Never had to navigate the unpredictable moods of someone under the influence.

They received a providing father. Material needs were met. Education was prioritized. Opportunities were created.

They received a present father—at least when I was home. I tried. I showed up for games and recitals and homework sessions. I told them I loved them.

But here's what they also received:

A father who was often absent—traveling for work, building the empire, chasing the success that would prove his worth.

A father who modeled performance—teaching them, inadvertently, that love is earned through achievement. That value comes from what you do, not who you are.

A father who couldn't fully feel—who could provide and protect but couldn't access the emotional depths that children need. Who could solve problems but couldn't sit with pain.

The covenant was still running: *love equals suffering*. So I kept love at arm's length, even with my own children. Close enough to fulfill duty. Not close enough to risk the kind of intimacy that could wound.

---

## The Cycle Continues

I didn't pass down the addiction. That's something.

I didn't pass down the chaos, the instability, the moment-to-moment uncertainty of living with someone in active disease.

But I did pass down something else.

Performance as love. Achievement as worth. The subtle message that you have to earn your place in the world.

These patterns transmit whether we intend them or not. Children don't do what we say—they do what we are. They absorb the unconscious programming, the unspoken rules, the things we model without knowing we're modeling them.

I told my children they were loved unconditionally.

But I modeled that love is conditional on performance.

I told them they were valuable just as they were.

But I modeled that value comes from what you accomplish.

The cycle continued—just in a more acceptable form.

---

## The Promise I Couldn't Keep

I had promised to break the cycle. To not pass down my pain.

But you cannot give what you don't have.

You cannot model integration when you are still fractured. You cannot teach authentic presence when you are still performing. You cannot pass down health when the wound beneath your sobriety remains unhealed.

The promise was sincere. I meant it with everything in me.

But meaning something is not the same as achieving it.

True cycle-breaking would require something I hadn't done yet: facing the original wound. Naming the covenants. Dying to the false self that was still running the show.

Until then, I would be a better iteration of brokenness—not a transformed human being.

My children would benefit from my improvements. They did.

But they would also inherit my limitations. They did that too.

---

## What I Know Now

After the transformation—after the ibogaine, after the covenants were burned before the throne, after I finally became the man my children deserved—I understood what I couldn't understand during those years:

**Parenting from woundedness always transfers the wound.**

It may take a different shape. It may be more subtle. But unhealed trauma finds a way to transmit itself.

**The best gift I could give my children was my own healing.**

Not my provision. Not my performance. Not my sacrifice of time and energy to build success.

My actual, genuine transformation.

**The children were not my salvation.**

As much as I loved them—and I loved them desperately—they could not heal me. Making them my reason for living placed an unfair burden on their tiny shoulders. They were not responsible for my wellbeing. I was.

**The cycle breaks when you break.**

When you finally face the wound. When you finally let the old self die. When you finally surrender the performance and become real.

That's when the inheritance changes.

That's when you can pass down something other than variations of your pain.

---

## Perla and Maverick Now

Today, my children know a different father.

Not perfect—transformation doesn't mean perfection. But present in a way I couldn't be before. Feeling in ways I couldn't access before. Authentic in ways I couldn't risk before.

They have seen me weep. Really weep—not the performative tears of sentiment, but the broken-open crying of a man who finally felt his feelings.

They have heard me apologize. Not the strategic apologies of damage control, but the genuine acknowledgment of where I fell short.

They have witnessed transformation. Not as a concept but as a lived reality. Their father became a different person—and that becoming gives them permission for their own.

I don't know what patterns I've already passed down. Some damage is done. Some transmissions have already occurred.

But I also know this: the story is not over.

For them or for me.

The work of undoing generational inheritance is ongoing. It requires constant attention, humble acknowledgment, willingness to see where the old patterns are still operating.

And it requires grace—for myself and for them—when we fail.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you have children—or if you one day will—I want to offer you something hard:*

*Your healing is more important than your provision.*

*Your transformation matters more than your sacrifice.*

*The internal work you do for yourself is also the most important work you can do for them.*

*Children don't need perfect parents. They need real parents. Parents who acknowledge their failures. Parents who apologize when wrong. Parents who are actively becoming something better.*

*The performance of perfect parenting is just another performance. And children see through performances, even when they can't articulate what they're seeing.*

*What breaks the cycle is not trying harder. It's becoming different.*

*Your children need you to heal—not so you can teach them how to heal, but so they can inherit something other than your wounds.*

*The generational patterns stop with the one who faces them.*

*Let that one be you.*
