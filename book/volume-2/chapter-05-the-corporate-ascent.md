# Chapter Five
## The Corporate Ascent

---

*2011-2018*

---

The call came at the right moment.

I was sober. Stable. Looking for a new direction after the wreckage of the previous decade.

And someone offered me a job at a company called Ideal Protein.

I had no idea what I was walking into.

Within seven years, I would accumulate $7.9 million in stock options. I would become Vice President of Sales. I would fly first class, travel on private jets, speak on stages to thousands.

The prodigal son was about to prove everyone wrong.

One more time.

---

## The Company

Ideal Protein was a medically developed weight loss protocol.

It wasn't just another diet company. The approach was science-based, physician-supervised, designed to address the metabolic realities of weight loss rather than the quick-fix promises of the industry.

This mattered to me.

After years of selling darkness—nightlife, self-destruction, empty glamour—I was hungry to sell something that actually helped people.

And Ideal Protein helped people. The transformations were real. The health outcomes were measurable. The lives changed were not just marketing material.

I could wake up in the morning and believe I was doing something good.

This alignment with values—health, transformation, genuine service—was part of why I gave myself so completely to the work.

The other part was the covenant.

*Just watch me.*

---

## The Climb

I started in sales.

The skills that had served me in nightlife—the charisma, the ability to read people, the talent for making someone feel like the most important person in the room—translated perfectly to this new environment.

Within months, I was outperforming expectations.

Within a year, I was leading a team.

Within a few years, I was Vice President of Sales.

The trajectory was vertical. My responsibilities expanded across North America, then internationally. I trained health professionals. I developed sales strategies. I built teams and systems and pipelines.

And I proved, every single day, that Nicholas Courchesne was not a failure.

*Just watch me.*

## The Trappings

The success came with its accessories.

First-class flights became routine. I would board a plane and turn left while others turned right, settling into seats that cost more than some people's monthly rent.

Private jets were not uncommon. When the schedule demanded it—and it often did—I would walk across the tarmac to a waiting aircraft, briefcase in hand, feeling like the man I had always imagined becoming.

Five-star hotels in cities across the world. Expense accounts that never seemed to have limits. Restaurants where the menu didn't list prices because if you had to ask, you didn't belong there.

On the surface, I had everything.

The boy who had left home at sixteen with nothing, who had sworn *one day you will hear about Nicholas Courchesne*—that boy's prophecy had come true.

Everyone was watching.

And I was performing brilliantly.

## The Stock Options

The real prize was on paper.

Over my years at Ideal Protein, I was granted significant stock options. These weren't just numbers on a spreadsheet—they were my financial future. My retirement. My children's inheritance.

By 2018, my options were worth over $7.9 million.

I remember sitting in my corner office one day, looking at the valuation, and thinking:

*I made it.*

The drug dealer from Ottawa who had been expelled from school. The alcoholic who had almost died in a snowstorm. The man with the criminal record and the trail of destruction.

I had done it.

Seven. Point. Nine. Million. Dollars.

*Just watch me.*

The covenant was fulfilled.

---

## The Emptiness

But here's what no one tells you about reaching the summit:

The view from the top often reveals that you've climbed the wrong mountain.

I had $7.9 million in options. I had the title, the team, the corner office. I had the respect of colleagues and the recognition of the industry.

And I felt empty.

Not the desperate emptiness of active addiction. Not the screaming void of psychosis and withdrawal.

A quieter emptiness. A subtle but persistent question:

*Is this all there is?*

I had achieved the goal I set at sixteen. I had proved everyone wrong. I had demonstrated, undeniably, that I could succeed.

And the success was ash in my mouth.

---

## The Diagnosis

Looking back, I can name what I couldn't name then:

My identity was still rooted in doing and having, not in being.

I was still proving rather than living. Still running rather than resting. Still performing rather than being present.

The stock options were just numbers. The title was just a word. The corner office was just a room with a view.

None of it addressed the wound.

None of it healed the little boy who had been abused.

None of it broke the covenants that were still running.

I had built a bigger, shinier tower. But it was still on sand.

And the sand was beginning to shift.

---

## The Warning Signs

By the mid-2010s, the cracks were showing.

My body was signaling distress. The travel, the pressure, the constant performance—it was taking a toll. I pushed through, of course. That's what performers do.

My mind was racing. The same driven intensity that had built the success was now becoming a liability. I couldn't turn it off. Couldn't rest. Couldn't simply be without doing.

My relationships were strained. Nancy and the children got the leftovers—whatever energy remained after I had given the best of myself to the job.

I was still sober. Eight consecutive years without a drink.

But I was not well.

The same patterns that had led to my breakdown in 2007 were resurfacing—just in a more acceptable form.

Workaholism instead of alcoholism.
Achievement addiction instead of substance addiction.
Corporate performance instead of nightclub performance.

I had traded one drug for another.

And the new drug was killing me just as surely, just more slowly.

---

## What Success Couldn't Touch

Here's what $7.9 million in stock options couldn't buy:

- The healing of childhood trauma
- The breaking of unconscious covenants
- The integration of the fractured self
- The capacity to feel deeply and truly
- The freedom from performance
- The peace that doesn't depend on achievement
- The identity that doesn't collapse when the title disappears

I had everything money could buy.

And none of the things money can't.

---

## The Setup for Collapse

I didn't know it yet, but 2018 was approaching.

February 26, 2018, to be specific.

The day my position would be eliminated in a reorganization.

The day $7.9 million would vanish—not because the company failed, but because I was no longer part of it.

The day my identity, built entirely on what I did and what I had, would face annihilation.

I had no idea what was coming.

I was too busy performing.

Too busy proving.

Too busy climbing a mountain that was about to crumble beneath my feet.

## What I Know Now

Looking back at the corporate ascent with eyes that have been transformed, I see what I couldn't see then:

**The success was genuine but insufficient.**

The work helped people. The achievement was real. I'm not dismissing what was accomplished.

But genuine success built on a fractured foundation is still built on a fractured foundation.

**The drive was pathological.**

What looked like ambition was actually addiction wearing a better suit. The need to achieve, to prove, to constantly perform—this was not health. It was wound.

**The identity was false.**

"Vice President of Sales at Ideal Protein with $7.9 million in options" was not who I was. It was a role I played. When the role was removed, the man beneath it would face an existential crisis.

**The collapse was necessary.**

This is the hardest truth. I needed to lose everything to discover what couldn't be lost.

I needed the towers to fall so I could finally build on something solid.

I needed the performance to end so I could begin to live.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you're climbing—if you're striving, achieving, accumulating—I want to ask you something:*

*What are you trying to prove? And to whom?*

*The drive that propels you upward—is it healthy ambition or wounded compulsion? Is it the expression of who you truly are or the performance of who you think you need to be?*

*Success is not the enemy. Achievement is not the problem.*

*The problem is when success becomes your identity. When achievement becomes your worth. When the doing and having replace the being.*

*You can reach the summit and find it empty.*

*You can accumulate millions and feel bankrupt.*

*You can prove everyone wrong and discover you've been asking the wrong question.*

*The question is not: What can I achieve?*

*The question is: Who am I when I achieve nothing?*

*If you don't have an answer to that question—if the thought of it fills you with terror—that's worth examining.*

*The towers we build to prove our worth are the same towers that imprison us.*

*And sometimes they have to fall for us to finally be free.*
