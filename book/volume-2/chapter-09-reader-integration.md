## Exercises and Reflections for Volume II

---

> *"Recovery without transformation is reformation without resurrection."*

---

You have just walked through the paradox at the heart of modern recovery:

You can get better without getting well.
You can be sober without being healed.
You can build an impressive new life on the same fractured foundation as the old one.

This chapter invites you to examine your own journey. Not to judge it, but to understand it. Not to dismiss what you've accomplished, but to ask whether there might be more.

## Section One: Evaluating Your Recovery

Whether you're in formal recovery from addiction or simply walking the path of personal growth, these questions can reveal where you are.

### Exercise 1.1: The Sobriety vs. Healing Inventory

Consider the following dimensions and rate yourself honestly on a scale of 1-10:

**Behavioral Change (Sobriety Dimension)**

| Question | Rating (1-10) |
|----------|---------------|
| I have stopped the destructive behaviors that brought me to crisis | |
| I have developed healthy habits to replace the old ones | |
| I have accountability structures in place | |
| I consistently show up for the practices that support my recovery | |

**Internal Transformation (Healing Dimension)**

| Question | Rating (1-10) |
|----------|---------------|
| I have identified and faced the wounds beneath my destructive behaviors | |
| I have broken unconscious covenants from my past | |
| I can access and express my emotions authentically | |
| My identity is rooted in who I am, not what I do or have | |
| I experience genuine peace, not just the absence of crisis | |

**Reflection:**
- Where are your scores higher: behavioral change or internal transformation?
- What does the gap (if any) reveal?
- If you've been focused primarily on behavior, what might deeper healing require?

### Exercise 1.2: The Performance Audit

Nicholas was performing recovery while remaining unchanged. This exercise helps you examine your own performances.

**In my recovery/growth journey, I may be performing...**

- [ ] Attendance at meetings or practices (being there without being present)
- [ ] Vulnerability (sharing scripted stories rather than real struggle)
- [ ] Service (helping others to avoid helping myself)
- [ ] Spiritual practices (going through motions without genuine connection)
- [ ] Progress (presenting improvement I haven't actually experienced)
- [ ] Gratitude (saying the right words without feeling the truth)

**The performance I'm most aware of is:**
_____________________________________________

**What am I protecting by performing instead of being real?**
_____________________________________________

**What might happen if I stopped this performance?**
_____________________________________________

---

## Section Two: The Identity Question

Nicholas's collapse revealed that his identity was entirely constructed from external factors. When those factors were removed, he didn't know who he was.

### Exercise 2.1: The Stripping Exercise

Imagine that the following were removed from your life. After each removal, write what would remain of your identity.

**If your job/career were removed:**
Who are you now? _____________________________________________

**If your relationships were removed:**
Who are you now? _____________________________________________

**If your achievements and accomplishments were removed:**
Who are you now? _____________________________________________

**If your possessions and financial status were removed:**
Who are you now? _____________________________________________

**If your reputation and how others see you were removed:**
Who are you now? _____________________________________________

**What remains when everything external is stripped away?**
_____________________________________________

**Reflection:**
- How difficult was this exercise?
- Did you find yourself reaching for other external identifiers?
- What does this reveal about where your identity is actually rooted?

---

### Exercise 2.2: Being vs. Doing vs. Having

Nicholas's identity was rooted in Doing and Having, not Being. This exercise helps you map your own pattern.

**My sense of worth comes from DOING:**
(List the activities, accomplishments, and roles that make you feel valuable)

1. _____________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________

**My sense of worth comes from HAVING:**
(List the possessions, relationships, and statuses that make you feel valuable)

1. _____________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________

**My sense of worth comes from BEING:**
(List the qualities of character and presence that would remain regardless of doing or having)

1. _____________________________________________
2. _____________________________________________
3. _____________________________________________

**Which list was easiest to fill?** _____________________________________________

**Which was hardest?** _____________________________________________

**What would it mean to live from Being rather than Doing or Having?**
_____________________________________________

## Section Three: The Covenant Check

Volume II revealed covenants still running in Nicholas's life despite his sobriety:

- *Love equals suffering*
- *I am my own god*
- *Just watch me*

### Exercise 3.1: Covenant Detection

Complete these sentences quickly, without overthinking:

**I will be successful when...**
_____________________________________________

**The way to earn love is...**
_____________________________________________

**I can't rely on anyone because...**
_____________________________________________

**I have to keep performing because...**
_____________________________________________

**If I stop achieving, people will...**
_____________________________________________

**I can't show weakness because...**
_____________________________________________

**Review your answers.** What covenants do they reveal? What silent agreements are governing your behavior?

---

### Exercise 3.2: The Origin of Your Covenants

For each covenant or belief you identified above:

**The Covenant/Belief:**
_____________________________________________

**When did I first learn this?**
_____________________________________________

**What experience(s) made this seem true?**
_____________________________________________

**How has this belief served me?**
_____________________________________________

**How has this belief limited me?**
_____________________________________________

**What might replace it?**
_____________________________________________

---

## Section Four: The Warning Signs

Nicholas ignored warning signs for years—physical, mental, relational, spiritual signals that something was wrong.

### Exercise 4.1: Your Body's Message

**What is your body trying to tell you?**

- Sleep patterns: _____________________________________________
- Energy levels: _____________________________________________
- Pain or tension: _____________________________________________
- Illness patterns: _____________________________________________
- Weight changes: _____________________________________________

**What have you been ignoring?**
_____________________________________________

---

### Exercise 4.2: Your Relationship Audit

**Who receives the best of you?**
_____________________________________________

**Who receives the leftovers?**
_____________________________________________

**What relationships are strained because of your patterns?**
_____________________________________________

**What would change if you were more present?**
_____________________________________________

---

### Exercise 4.3: Your Spiritual Condition

**My spiritual practices have become...**
- [ ] Genuine encounters with the Divine
- [ ] Routine habits I perform without presence
- [ ] Rarely practiced at all
- [ ] Transactional (giving to get)

**My experience of peace is...**
- [ ] Consistent and deep
- [ ] Occasional and surface-level
- [ ] Absent, replaced by activity
- [ ] Something I perform rather than feel

**What is my soul trying to tell me?**
_____________________________________________

---

## Section Five: The Collapse Question

Sometimes things have to fall for something better to be built. This section helps you consider what might need to fall in your life—voluntarily, before it falls involuntarily.

### Exercise 5.1: What Needs to Fall?

**What in my life is built on sand?**
(Identify structures, achievements, identities that are unsustainable)

_____________________________________________

**What am I holding onto that's preventing growth?**
_____________________________________________

**What would I need to release to make room for transformation?**
_____________________________________________

**What am I afraid would happen if I let it go?**
_____________________________________________

---

### Exercise 5.2: Voluntary Collapse

Involuntary collapse is brutal. Voluntary release is gentler. Consider:

**What could I release before it's taken from me?**

| What to Release | What I Fear Losing | What I Might Gain |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| | | |
| | | |
| | | |

---

## Section Six: Beyond Recovery

If sobriety is the doorway, not the destination, what lies beyond?

### Exercise 6.1: What Would Full Healing Look Like?

**Imagine yourself fully healed—not just sober, not just recovered, but transformed. Describe:**

**How would you feel in your body?**
_____________________________________________

**What would your mind be like?**
_____________________________________________

**How would you show up in relationships?**
_____________________________________________

**What would your relationship with yourself be like?**
_____________________________________________

**What would your spiritual life look like?**
_____________________________________________

---

### Exercise 6.2: The Gap

**Compare the vision above to your current reality. Where is the gap largest?**
_____________________________________________

**What would it take to close that gap?**
_____________________________________________

**What help would you need?**
_____________________________________________

**What are you willing to do that you haven't done yet?**
_____________________________________________

---

## Final Reflection

Volume II ends with collapse—not because collapse is the final word, but because sometimes everything has to fall before something new can rise.

**As you close this volume, ask yourself:**

1. What is the most important insight I've received?

_____________________________________________

2. What truth have I been avoiding that I'm now ready to face?

_____________________________________________

3. What one action will I take as a result of this reading?

_____________________________________________

---

**Remember:**

The towers that fell for Nicholas were not the end of his story.

They were the beginning of his resurrection.

The collapse created the opening for something genuine to be built.

The same can be true for you.

*"You can be sober and still be sick. You can be successful and still be suffering. True healing requires going deeper."*

— Nicholas Courchesne

**Proceed to Volume III: The Dark Night**

*Where we enter the darkest three years—bipolar diagnosis, hospitalizations, relapses, and the whispers that say your family would be better off without you. And where, in the deepest darkness, a glimmer of light appears.*
