# Chapter Seven
## The Warning Signs

---

*Eight Years Sober but Still Running*

---

The body always knows.

Long before the mind admits what's happening, long before the collapse becomes undeniable, the body sends signals.

I ignored them for years.

---

## The Physical Toll

By 2017, my body was screaming.

The constant travel had wrecked my sleep. Time zones blurred together. I couldn't remember when I had last woken up feeling rested.

My weight fluctuated. My energy came in manic bursts followed by crashes. My nervous system was permanently set to high alert—ready for the next crisis, the next demand, the next performance.

I pushed through. That's what performers do.

I told myself I would rest when the work was done. When the deal closed. When the quarter ended. When the kids were older. When the coaching practice was more established.

The rest was always just around the corner.

I was forty-seven years old before I understood that the rest would never come as long as I was running from something.

---

## The Mental Toll

My mind was a prison.

The same racing thoughts that had characterized my addiction years were still racing—just without the substances. I couldn't turn off the analysis, the planning, the constant optimization of everything.

I was obsessed with efficiency. With productivity. With squeezing every possible unit of value from every possible moment.

Rest felt like failure.
Stillness felt like death.
Being without doing felt like non-existence.

I meditated, but I meditated productively—checking it off the list, tracking my streaks, optimizing my practice.

I prayed, but I prayed transactionally—approaching God like a cosmic vending machine, inserting spiritual currency and expecting returns.

I couldn't simply be. Not for five minutes. Not ever.

## The Relational Toll

Nancy got whatever was left.

After the flights and the meetings and the client sessions and the recovery commitments—after everything that "had to be done"—she received the dregs.

The tired version of me. The distracted version. The version that was physically present but mentally somewhere else.

The children were growing up with a father who was a concept more than a presence. I showed up for the important things—at least, what I defined as important. But the daily texture of their lives, the small moments that actually form children—those often happened without me.

I was building a legacy for them, I told myself.

What I was actually doing was repeating the same pattern my parents had resisted: sacrificing relationship for achievement.

The children didn't need my legacy. They needed me.

They didn't need my success stories. They needed my presence.

And I couldn't give what I didn't have.

---

## The Spiritual Toll

My recovery had become routine.

The meetings I attended felt like obligations rather than lifelines. The steps I had worked felt completed rather than ongoing. The spiritual awakening I was supposed to experience felt like something that might happen eventually, not something I was living now.

I had a God of my understanding. But the understanding was shallow—a theological framework that provided structure without presence, concept without encounter.

I knew about God. I didn't know God.

And there's a vast difference.

---

## What Others Saw

From the outside, I looked like a success story.

Eight years sober. Beautiful family. Corner office. Speaking engagements. Coaching clients who were genuinely helped.

The narrative was redemption: the prodigal son who came home, got his life together, and now thrived.

No one saw the hamster wheel inside. The constant running. The exhaustion masked by productivity. The performance that never stopped, even in private.

Not even Nancy knew the full extent. She knew something was wrong—she always knew—but I had become expert at deflecting her concern.

"I'm fine."
"Just tired."
"Things will slow down after this project."

The same phrases, repeated until they lost all meaning.

---

## The Whisper I Couldn't Hear

There was a voice trying to reach me.

The same voice that had spoken in the snowstorm. The same presence that had been pursuing me since childhood.

It whispered:

*Stop.*

*This is not the life you were made for.*

*The performance can end.*

*There is another way.*

But I couldn't hear it. The noise was too loud—the internal noise, the external demands, the constant motion that kept me from standing still long enough to listen.

Or maybe I could hear it and was afraid to listen.

Because stopping meant facing what I was running from.

And I still wasn't ready for that.

---

## The Same Patterns, Different Substance

Here's what I couldn't see:

I was still an addict.

The substance had changed. Instead of alcohol, I was addicted to achievement. Instead of cocaine, I was hooked on productivity. Instead of nightlife, I was dependent on work.

The behaviors looked different. The underlying pattern was identical.

- Using something external to manage internal pain
- Running from feelings instead of facing them
- Building identity on what I did rather than who I was
- Depleting myself in pursuit of a satisfaction that never came

Addiction isn't really about the substance. It's about the relationship to the substance—the dependency, the compulsive use, the way it becomes necessary for function.

By this definition, I was as addicted in my eight years of sobriety as I had been in my decades of drinking.

I had just found a more socially acceptable drug.

---

## The Crash Approaching

The body was sending signals I was ignoring.

The mind was running patterns I couldn't see.

The soul was starving while I fed it accomplishment.

Something had to give.

February 26, 2018 was approaching.

The day everything I had built would collapse. The day $7.9 million would vanish. The day the identity I had constructed would face annihilation.

I had no idea what was coming.

I was too busy performing to notice the foundation crumbling beneath my feet.

---

## What I Know Now

Looking back at those final years before the collapse, I see what I couldn't see then:

**The warning signs were everywhere.**

Body, mind, spirit, relationships—every dimension of my life was signaling distress. I just wasn't listening.

**Sobriety can become its own trap.**

Eight years of not drinking became a point of pride rather than a foundation for deeper work. I mistook the absence of substances for the presence of healing.

**High performance often masks high dysfunction.**

The same drive that produces impressive results often comes from profound brokenness. Success can be a sophisticated hiding place.

**You can only run for so long.**

Eventually, the body breaks down, the relationships fray, the soul demands attention. What you refuse to face voluntarily, life will force you to face involuntarily.

*Dear Traveler,*

*What are your warning signs?*

*Is your body trying to tell you something you've been ignoring?*

*Is your mind racing with patterns you can't seem to interrupt?*

*Are your relationships receiving the dregs of a depleted soul?*

*We are masters of ignoring what we don't want to see. We tell ourselves we'll slow down later. We promise we'll address it when things calm down.*

*But later never comes.*

*The signals get louder until they become crises. The whispers become screams. The warnings become collapses.*

*You have a choice: face it now or be forced to face it later.*

*Now is gentler.*

*Now still has room for voluntary change.*

*Now is the opportunity that later will look back on with regret.*

*What is your life trying to tell you?*

*What signal are you refusing to hear?*

*What collapse is approaching that you could still prevent—if you stopped running long enough to listen?*
