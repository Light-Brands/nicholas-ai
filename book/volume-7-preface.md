# Preface to Volume VII: The Epicenter Expands
## Becoming the Healing You Received

---

Dear Traveler,

Your wounds, once healed, become doors for others.

This is the sacred arithmetic of the Kingdom: nothing is wasted. The abuse you suffered, the addictions you battled, the towers you built and watched fall, the dark nights you barely survived, the covenants that ruled you, the identity you lost and reclaimed—all of it becomes the curriculum of your calling. All of it becomes the medicine you offer to others who walk where you once walked.

For six volumes, I have taken you through my journey. From fractured foundation to attempted resurrection. From dark night to sacred encounter. From revelation to integration to identity reclaimed. The internal work. The personal transformation. The becoming of a whole man.

But wholeness is not the destination. Wholeness is the foundation.

Now we build.

I have received a divine mandate. It came not as a booming voice from heaven but as a steady knowing that grew louder with each stage of my transformation: *I am called to help entrepreneurial married couples navigate infidelity, addiction, mental health, and burnout. I am called to serve leaders who have achieved everything and woke to emptiness. I am called to reach the lost travelers—the successful ones who are secretly failing, the recovered ones who have never truly healed, the strong ones who are crumbling inside.*

The vision is specific: thirty or more Transformational Epicenter locations around the globe. Not treatment centers—epicenters. Places where transformation radiates outward. Communities where the seven pillars are lived and taught. Hubs from which the Kingdom advances against the spirits of religion, addiction, divorce, sickness, and poverty.

This is not ambition. This is obedience.

I share this vision with humility, knowing that what I see may be beyond what I will live to accomplish. But I also share it with confidence, because I know who called me and I know what He can do through surrendered vessels. The same God who met me in the darkness, who burned my covenants in heavenly fire, who restored my marriage and my sleep and my sanity—that God does not give vision without provision.

Nancy's sacred contract is revealed in this final volume. For years, she loved me when I was unlovable. She stayed when leaving would have been justified. She believed in a version of me that I could not yet see. And now, as I step into my mandate, I understand: her contract was never just to love me into awakening. It was to awaken others together.

The legacy we leave to Perla and Maverick is not wealth, though I pray there will be abundance. It is not reputation, though I pray our name will be honorable. The legacy is this: *the promise that generational trauma ends in our bodies. The proof that wounds can become doors. The model of a marriage that died and was resurrected.*

This is what we give them. This is what we give the world.

If you have traveled with me through these seven volumes, you have not merely read a story. You have walked a path. You have excavated your own foundation. You have named your own covenants. You have faced your own dark night. And now, I suspect, you are beginning to hear your own mandate.

What is the healing you have received that you are now called to become for others?

Where are the lost travelers you are uniquely positioned to guide home?

What is the epicenter that wants to emerge from your transformed life?

The garden is not a place to hide from the world. The garden is the place from which you bless the world. You were called home not to stay in solitude but to become a beacon for others who forgot the way.

Welcome home, dear traveler.

Now, let us bring the others.

With love and kingdom vision,
