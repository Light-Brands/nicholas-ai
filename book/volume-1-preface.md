# Preface to Volume I: The Fractured Foundation
## Building Towers on Sand (1980-2007)

---

Dear Traveler,

I need to tell you something before we begin.

You are not broken.

I know that sounds strange coming from a man about to lay bare the fractures in his own foundation. But stay with me. What you are about to read is not a confession of weakness—it is an excavation of truth. And truth, even when it cuts, is the only ground solid enough to build upon.

I was born in 1980 into a home filled with faith. My grandmother raised me until I was four, and her love planted something in me that no amount of darkness could fully uproot. At four years old, I told my father he needed Jesus. The words came through me, not from me. I didn't understand then what I know now: that even as a child, I was connected to something eternal.

But something else happened in those early years. Something I could not speak of for decades. Between the ages of eight and eleven, I was sexually abused. And in that violation, a covenant was formed in the silence of my wounded soul—a covenant I didn't choose, didn't understand, and couldn't see. It would govern my life for the next thirty years.

*Love equals suffering.*

This invisible agreement became the operating system of my existence. And upon that fractured foundation, I built towers. Magnificent, gleaming towers that everyone admired.

By sixteen, I had left home. By twenty-one, I was a millionaire in the Toronto and New York nightlife scene. I built Extreme Blendz. Zugari. M1 Boxing. I performed excellence so convincingly that even I believed it was real. My towers reached toward heaven, but their foundations were sinking into sand.

You cannot heal what you refuse to see.

This is the sacred truth of Volume One. Not that seeing guarantees healing—it doesn't. But refusing to see guarantees continued bondage. The fractures I denied didn't disappear. They simply ran deeper, spreading through every relationship, every achievement, every quiet moment when the applause stopped and I was left alone with myself.

By May of 2007, I was drinking forty to sixty ounces of liquor daily. The towers were falling. The foundation was finally giving way to what it always was: sand.

I share this with you not to glorify my suffering or to perform my pain for your sympathy. I share it because somewhere, right now, you may be standing in your own tower, feeling the subtle tremors beneath your feet. You may be smiling for cameras while dying in silence. You may be wondering why achievement feels so empty, why success tastes like ash, why you have everything and yet possess nothing.

You are not broken, dear traveler.

But your foundation might be fractured. And the only way forward is to look back—not to live there, but to understand what was built and why.

This volume is an invitation to excavate. To trace the cracks in your own foundation. To identify the covenants you never consciously made but have faithfully kept. To see, perhaps for the first time, the invisible agreements that have governed your life.

I will not ask you to trust me yet. We are only beginning. But I will ask you to stay curious. Stay open. And most importantly, stay honest with yourself.

The garden of your soul is waiting for you to come home.

But first, we must understand why we left.

With love from the other side of the wilderness,
