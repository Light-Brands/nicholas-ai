# Chapter Six
## The Baptism of Love

---

*"Feeling Nancy's Pain for the First Time"*

---

I had been married for seventeen years.

I had loved my wife. I had provided for her. I had shared a bed, a home, a life with her.

But I had never actually felt her pain.

Not until the second ibogaine booster after my Bufo experience.

And when I did, everything changed.

---

## The Unexpected Invitation

The day after my first booster following Bufo, Dr. Mariana came to see me.

"Are you ready for your second booster dose?"

I was surprised. I thought I was done. The protocol seemed complete. The revelations had been profound. What more was there?

But something deeper was inviting me.

Something that knew there was unfinished work.

I said yes.

---

## The Pain That Wasn't Mine

The second booster began gently. An hour passed with waves of integration from the previous experiences.

And then, without warning, I began to feel pain.

Not my pain. Something different.

Raw, unbearable waves of suffering rose through my body and soul. Heartbreak. Despair. Loneliness. A depth of anguish that threatened to overwhelm me.

I didn't understand what was happening.

And then, revelation:

**It wasn't my pain. It was hers. It was Nancy's pain.**

---

## Seventeen Years

For seventeen years, I had been protected from feeling what she felt.

The walls I built to protect myself from my own pain had also blocked me from hers. I could intellectually acknowledge that I had hurt her. I could apologize. I could express regret.

But I could not *feel* what she had experienced.

The years of my addiction—watching her husband destroy himself.

The relapses—each one a betrayal of the hope she held.

The hospitalizations—not knowing if I would come home alive.

The suicidal ideation—knowing her husband was constantly considering leaving her through death.

The emotional unavailability—trying to connect with a man who was behind walls, performing love but unable to actually give it.

All of it.

For seventeen years.

She had carried this alone.

And now, in that room in Cancun, I was finally feeling what she had carried.

---

## Almost Too Much

The pain was almost too much for my human flesh to bear.

I understood, in that moment, why we build walls. The full weight of another person's suffering—especially suffering we have caused—is devastating. It is more comfortable to stay protected, to remain at a distance, to intellectualize rather than feel.

But the walls that protect also imprison.

I could not truly love Nancy while unable to feel her.

So I let the pain come.

I let it wash through me.

I wept as I have never wept.

---

## The Attack

In the midst of this experience, the enemy attacked.

The voice of shame rose up:

*"You deserve this. Feel it. You're responsible. Carry it. Be guilty. Be ashamed."*

Images of my failures flashed before me. Every relapse. Every broken promise. Every moment I had chosen self-destruction over love.

The accuser wanted me to drown in guilt. To be crushed by the weight of what I had done.

But in the middle of the torment, God spoke:

**"It is your love, Nicholas. Your love will dissolve your pain."**

---

## The Sacred Contract

I wept. "Why? How could she stay? How could she love me after all this?"

**"I gave her a soul contract—to love you into awakening, to bring you into remembrance of who you truly are."**

I understood.

Nancy's persistence through years of my destruction was not codependency. It was not weakness. It was not enabling.

It was calling.

God had joined us together for a purpose larger than comfortable partnership. She was assigned to love me into awakening. To hold the vision of who I could become even when I couldn't see it. To remain when leaving would have been justified.

Her suffering was not meaningless.

It was intercession.

And now, finally, her prayers were being answered.

---

## The Morning After

When I woke the next morning, there was complete peace.

The pain had passed through me. It was no longer stuck, no longer avoided, no longer managed through walls. It had been felt, honored, integrated.

I called Nancy. When her face appeared on the screen, I broke.

I sobbed uncontrollably—tears of surrender, of love, of truth.

"I feel it," I told her. "I finally feel what you've carried. I'm so sorry. I had no idea."

She wept too.

"I can tell," she said. "Something is different. I can feel that you feel it."

---

## The Divine Explanation

God revealed the sequence:

*"Son, you couldn't go deep with her during the flood dose. Remember? Her eye, watching from a distance?"*

I remembered. The brief vision of Nancy. The distance I couldn't bridge.

*"First, you had to make peace with your own pain. Only then could you feel hers."*

This is the divine order of healing.

We cannot feel another's pain while we are still running from our own.

We cannot love authentically while we are still protected by walls.

The flood dose healed my wounds. The Bufo revealed ultimate truth. And only then—only after my own healing had progressed—could I receive the baptism of love that allows us to feel another's heart.

---

## The Communion

I now understand what the baptism of love is:

It is the capacity to feel another person's pain without being destroyed by it.

It is not masochism. It is not wallowing in suffering.

It is communion.

It is what happens when two hearts are no longer separated by walls.

Because only when you have embraced your own suffering can you **love** another's with compassion.

Love without this communion is performance. It can be kind. It can be attentive. But it lacks the depth that makes love transformative.

Love with this communion is resurrection. It heals not just by doing nice things but by actually being present to the reality of the other person.

I had been doing love for seventeen years.

Now I was being love.

## For Spouses

If you love someone who has caused you pain—if you have waited, hoped, prayed for their transformation—know this:

Your suffering is not wasted.

Your intercession is not unheard.

The day may come when they finally feel what you've carried. When the walls come down. When they can meet you in the depth.

That day is worth waiting for.

And if you are the one who has caused pain—if you have hurt the one you love through addiction, unavailability, self-destruction—know this:

The walls that protect you also imprison you.

Until you can feel their pain, you cannot truly love them.

The healing you need is not just for you. It's for them too. It's for the marriage that waits on the other side.

Let the walls down.

Feel what they've carried.

It will hurt.

But on the other side is love you've never known.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*The baptism of love is not for the faint of heart.*

*It requires willingness to feel what you've avoided.*

*But there is no authentic love without it.*

*The walls that protect you from pain also protect you from intimacy.*

*You cannot have depth and distance at the same time.*

*If you want real love—love that heals, love that transforms, love that reflects the heart of God—you must be willing to feel.*

*Feel your own pain first.*

*Then feel theirs.*

*And in the feeling, discover communion.*
