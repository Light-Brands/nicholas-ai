# Chapter One
## The Four Boosters

---

*"Cleansing, Vision, Battle, Stillness"*

---

The flood dose was the earthquake.

It broke open what had been sealed for decades. It exposed the covenants. It brought me before the Throne. It burned what needed to burn.

But earthquakes leave debris.

The four booster doses that followed the flood dose served a different purpose. While the flood was about breaking, the boosters were about building. About anchoring. About sealing what had been opened and cleaning what had been exposed.

Each booster had its own character. Its own lesson. Its own gift.

## Understanding the Protocol

At Transcend Clinic, the protocol included booster doses of ibogaine following the primary flood experience.

These are smaller doses, administered over several days, each one extending and deepening the initial work. Where the flood dose might be compared to surgery, the boosters are more like the recovery room—monitoring what was changed, addressing complications, ensuring the healing takes root.

The medical team explained: "The flood dose opens everything. The boosters help integrate what was opened. Each one tends to bring a different quality of experience."

I would discover how true this was.

## Booster One: The Cleansing

**Theme: Restoration of Memory and Sleep**

The first booster came the day after the flood dose.

I was still raw. Still processing the visions—my father, my children, the abuser, the throne room. My nervous system was tender, like flesh that has just come out of surgery.

The booster felt different than the flood. Gentler. Less overwhelming. More like waves washing through me than a flood breaking through.

And the waves were cleansing.

I kept receiving the same message, repeated like a mantra:

*God is using ibogaine to restore my memory and repair my sleep.*

Again and again. The phrase filled me with peace.

For years, my memory had been fragmented. Depression, medications, the constant stress of survival mode—all of it had affected my cognitive function. I would forget conversations, lose track of details, struggle to recall things that should have been easily accessible.

And sleep—sleep had been my enemy for so long. The Zopiclone dependency. The racing mind. The three or four hours of fitful rest that left me exhausted even after "sleeping."

In the cleansing of the first booster, I felt God addressing these physical realities. Not just the spiritual wounds—the neurological damage. The biological impact of decades of trauma and substance.

He was restoring what had been degraded.

## The Ambassador Calling

During this first booster, something else emerged.

A sense of calling. Not vague spiritual aspiration, but specific mission.

I was to become an **ambassador of God's creation**.

The medicines I was receiving—ibogaine, and later Bufo—were not drugs in the recreational sense. They were tools God had created. Molecules embedded in plants, placed on earth for healing, used for centuries by indigenous peoples who understood their sacred purpose.

My calling was to share this truth.

Not to promote substances indiscriminately. But to bear witness that God sometimes heals through pathways the conventional world dismisses or fears. That the Creator who made us also made the means for our restoration. That Christians who pray for healing may find their prayers answered through unexpected channels.

I also felt called to bring this message to the recovery community.

I had been in AA and NA for years. I had witnessed something troubling: people with years of abstinence, decades of "clean time," still fighting demons. Still confessing anxiety, depression, trauma, insomnia. Still white-knuckling their way through life.

Sobriety is not healing.

I was living proof.

And there were tools—sacred tools—that could take people beyond sobriety into actual freedom.

## Booster Two: The Vision

**Theme: Protection, Purpose, and Integrity**

The second booster shifted everything.

I was moved from the medical room to my personal room for this dose. Looking out the window at the Caribbean sky, clouds stretching like tapestry, I felt awe fill my being.

And then the visions began.

**Pepe the Guardian**

First came Pepe—my childhood dog.

I barely remembered him. He died when I was very young, and my memories of that period are fragmented. But family stories told of how protective he was, always guarding me, never letting harm approach.

In seeing Pepe, I received a message about protection:

*I have always been protected. Even in the earliest years, when I was most vulnerable, God's shield was around me.*

Even when the abuse happened. Even when it seemed like no protection was present. God had limits—he does not override human will—but His protection was still there, limiting the damage, preserving something in me that the enemy wanted to destroy.

**Purpose-Driven Work**

God showed me clarity around business and purpose.

I had spent years building things—businesses, organizations, projects. Some had succeeded wildly. Others had crashed. The pattern was chaotic.

What I saw now: the problem was not ambition. The problem was disorder.

I had moved in excitement and reactivity, investing time, energy, and money without proper agreements, without clear structure, without alignment with divine order.

The correction was clear: **Order first—then expansion.**

Build on foundation. Establish agreements before action. Move from alignment, not impulse.

**Integrity of Word**

The deepest conviction of this booster: integrity with my word.

My word is my bond—greater than any signed contract.

But I had not lived this way. I had given my word and failed to complete. I had made commitments and broken them. I had said yes when I should have said no, and then defaulted on the yes.

That season was finished.

From this moment forward: completion, integrity, truth.

## Booster Three: The Battle

**Theme: Victory Over the Enemy**

The third booster was the most intense.

Where the first was cleansing and the second was vision, the third was warfare.

I came face to face with the devil himself.

Not as a theological concept. Not as a metaphor for my own darkness. As a presence—malevolent, intelligent, ancient—who had been working to destroy me for forty-five years.

I saw how he operated. The whispers of shame. The accusations. The temptations timed perfectly for moments of weakness. The suicidal ideation that came with such convincing logic.

He had tried to steal my destiny. He had tried to keep me imprisoned in covenants. He had tried to take me out—literally, through death—because he knew what I was meant to become.

But the battle had already been won.

Standing in the authority of Christ—washed in His blood, resurrected in His power, sealed by His Spirit—I looked at the enemy not as victim but as **victor**.

I spoke with authority I had never known:

*"You tried. You tried to take me out so many times because you knew I was chosen. Because you knew my pain would become purpose. But you failed. My mind is now guarded by the Holy Spirit. It is finished. I am free."*

For nearly fifteen minutes, I stood in dominion, proclaiming truth, kicking back the darkness.

It was not my strength. It was borrowed authority. The authority that belongs to every child of God who has been seated with Christ in heavenly places.

**Technology and Addiction**

In this same booster, God revealed another battleground: my phone.

I had been addicted to it. Not just the device—the constant stimulation. The false sense of control. The endless scrolling that numbed the mind and stole presence.

Social media, news feeds, compulsive checking—these were not neutral. They were hypnotizers, designed to drain attention and presence.

I claimed dominion over technology: it would serve me, not control me. I would use it with intention, for kingdom purpose, not as an escape from being present.

---

## Booster Four: The Stillness

**Theme: Discernment and Family**

The fourth booster was the quietest.

After the intensity of the battle, this dose unfolded in deep calm. Serenity. Rest.

In the stillness, I received conviction about discernment.

Not every spiritual experience is from God. Not every revelation carries divine authority. There are spirits, energies, and portals that masquerade as light but are not aligned with truth.

The touchstone is the Trinitarian God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Any experience, any message, any invitation that does not align with Scripture and does not honor the Trinity should be examined carefully.

I had to walk with vigilance. The doors that had been opened through the medicine could be doorways for many things. I needed to guard what I allowed in.

**Christ as Model**

Jesus revealed Himself as the ultimate example.

He was the rebel of rebels. The savage of savages. He overturned every expectation, broke every religious assumption, lived with a freedom that scandalized the religious establishment.

And His way of living flowed not from performance but from being.

His identity, purpose, and truth were rooted in perfect union with the Father. He acted only in obedience to what He saw and heard from God.

This was my pattern. Not rule-following. Not striving. Abiding. Listening. Obeying with childlike trust.

**Family Centrality**

The final revelation of the fourth booster: family.

Nancy needed me. Not my words—my presence. Not my explanations—my behavior. Not my promises—my fruit.

It was my tenderness, my intentional attention to small details, my consistent presence that would testify to the reality of God in me.

I could not convince her of my transformation.

I could only live it.

## What the Boosters Taught

Looking back, the four boosters formed a complete sequence:

1. **Cleansing** — Washing the debris, restoring what trauma damaged
2. **Vision** — Seeing clearly the path forward, the calling, the purpose
3. **Battle** — Standing in authority against the enemy, claiming victory
4. **Stillness** — Resting in discernment, returning to family, preparing for daily life

The flood dose was the earthquake.

The boosters were the rebuilding.

And the integration had only just begun.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you undergo any profound healing experience, know this: the experience is not the end.*

*The aftermath matters as much as the encounter.*

*What gets cleansed must stay clean. What gets revealed must be lived. What gets battled must stay defeated. What gets stilled must remain centered.*

*Integration is not automatic.*

*It is chosen, daily, moment by moment.*

*The boosters taught me this: healing is a process, not an event. Freedom is a practice, not a possession.*

*Whatever doors have opened for you—guard them.*

*Whatever truth has been revealed—live it.*

*The work continues.*
