## Return to Transcend

---

*"90 Days of Living in Presence"*

---

Ninety days after my sacred encounter with ibogaine, I returned to Transcend Clinic.

Not because the healing had failed.

Because the healing had succeeded—and I wanted to go deeper.

---

## The Ninety Days

Let me describe what those ninety days were like.

After returning home from the initial flood dose and boosters, I expected some kind of crash. Every previous high in my life—whether chemical, emotional, or circumstantial—had been followed by a fall. I assumed the freedom I felt would fade. The whispers would return. The old patterns would reassert themselves.

They didn't.

Day after day, the freedom persisted.

I would wake in the morning—naturally, without Zopiclone—and realize I had slept seven hours. Then eight. My body was remembering how to rest.

I would sit with my family at breakfast and be *present*. Not managing anxiety while pretending to be present. Actually there. Actually engaged.

I would go about my day without the constant backdrop of depression coloring everything gray. Colors were vivid again. Food had flavor. Music had depth.

The suicidal ideation did not return. Not once. The voice that had whispered for months that my family would be better off without me—silent.

---

## Living in Presence

What I discovered during those ninety days was a new way of being.

I was no longer living in reaction, regret, or anticipation.

I was living in **presence**.

For most of my life, I had been a time-traveler. My mind constantly journeyed to the past through guilt and shame (which manifested as depression) or to the future through fear and anxiety (which manifested as panic).

Now, something had changed in the machinery of my consciousness.

I could look at the past—to learn, to process—but without being dragged back there. The memories existed, but they no longer defined my present moment.

I could look at the future—to plan, to co-create with God—but without being pulled forward in anxiety. The future was a canvas, not a threat.

The only moment that was real was now.

And now was peaceful.

## The Internal Compass

During this season, I discovered that peace and joy had become my internal compass.

When I was aligned—when I was present, when I was operating in divine order—peace and joy were the baseline. Not euphoria, not artificial happiness. A deep, stable sense of wellbeing that did not depend on circumstances.

When I stepped out of alignment—when I let anxiety grip me, when I moved in reactivity rather than response, when I allowed old patterns to reassert themselves—the peace would dim. The joy would fade.

This was not punishment. It was information.

The dimming of peace was a signal: *You've stepped outside of presence. Return.*

And returning was possible. Through breath. Through prayer. Through gratitude. Through the simple act of noticing that I had wandered and choosing to come back.

The garden was not a distant destination.

It was always available.

I only had to choose it.

---

## The Invitation

When the ninety-day mark approached, I received an invitation from Transcend.

They offered the opportunity to return for additional work—specifically, for Bufo (5-MeO-DMT), a medicine with a different character than ibogaine.

I prayed about it. I talked with Nancy. I consulted with Paul, who had been supporting my integration.

Everything aligned.

I booked my return.

---

## Arriving Again

Returning to Cancun ninety days later was surreal.

The last time I had arrived, I was in the darkest season of my life. Suicidal. Dependent on medication. Desperate for transformation or death.

Now I arrived as a different man.

Not perfect. Not finished. But fundamentally changed.

The staff noticed immediately. The nurses who had cared for me during my flood dose—they saw the difference in my eyes, my posture, my presence.

"You look like a different person," one of them said.

I was.

---

## The Purpose of Return

Why return if the healing had taken?

Because integration is not just about maintaining what was gained.

It's about deepening.

The flood dose had broken the covenants. The boosters had cleaned and sealed. Ninety days of daily practice had begun to anchor the transformation in ordinary life.

But there were layers still. Depths still unexplored. Revelations still waiting.

Bufo, they explained, was different from ibogaine. If ibogaine was surgery—cutting, removing, rewiring—Bufo was revelation. A brief but overwhelming encounter with something beyond the individual self.

"Ibogaine shows you the story of your life," one guide explained. "Bufo shows you what lies beyond all stories."

I was ready.

## The Night Before

The night before the Bufo ceremony, I sat alone on the balcony of my room.

The Caribbean stars stretched overhead. The sound of waves reached me faintly.

I thought about the man who had arrived ninety days ago. The terror he carried. The chains that bound him. The covenants written on his soul.

That man felt like a memory now. Someone I used to be. Someone whose suffering I could recall but no longer inhabited.

I was grateful.

Grateful for the medicine. Grateful for the clinic. Grateful for everyone who had supported my journey.

And I was open.

Open to whatever came next.

Open to going deeper.

Open to revelation.

The morning would bring the vertical awakening.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you have experienced transformation, guard it.*

*The enemy will try to convince you it wasn't real. That the changes won't last. That you'll inevitably return to who you were.*

*This is a lie.*

*Transformation is real. Change persists. New creation is possible.*

*But transformation also deepens.*

*The initial breakthrough is only the beginning. There are always more layers, more depths, more revelation available.*

*Stay humble. Stay open. Stay willing to return to the places that facilitated your healing.*

*The garden has many rooms.*

*You have only begun to explore.*
