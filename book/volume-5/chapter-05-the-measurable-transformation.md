# Chapter Five
## The Measurable Transformation

---

*"From Suicidal Ideation to 7-8 Hours Natural Sleep"*

---

I am suspicious of transformation claims that cannot be measured.

Spiritual experiences can be compelling. Stories can be moving. But the question remains: did anything actually change?

In my case, the answer is unequivocal.

This chapter documents the measurable transformations that followed my sacred encounters—concrete, observable changes that cannot be attributed to placebo effect, wishful thinking, or selective memory.

## Before: The Baseline

Let me establish the baseline—what life looked like before the ibogaine and Bufo experiences:

**Sleep:**
- Chronic insomnia for over a decade
- Dependent on Zopiclone (sleeping medication) nightly
- Typical sleep: 3-4 hours, fragmented
- Never woke feeling rested
- Sleep quality degrading over time despite medication increases

**Mental Health:**
- Active suicidal ideation (constant thoughts that family would be better off without me)
- Clinical depression requiring medication
- Anxiety requiring medication
- Panic attacks (multiple per month)
- Bipolar Type 2 diagnosis with cycling

**Nervous System:**
- Constant fight-or-flight activation
- Hypervigilance
- Baseline state: survival mode
- Could not relax without substances
- Body always on alert

**Medications:**
- Zopiclone for sleep
- Mood stabilizers
- Antidepressants
- Anti-anxiety medication
- As-needed medications for breakthrough symptoms

**Presence:**
- Unable to be present with family
- Mind constantly time-traveling (past/future)
- Emotional unavailability behind walls
- Performance of presence rather than actual presence

---

## After: Ninety Days Post-Treatment

Here is what changed:

**Sleep:**
- Natural sleep restored: 7-8 hours per night consistently
- 40-50% of sleep in deep and REM stages (verified by tracking)
- Wake feeling rested
- No sleep medication required
- Fall asleep within 15-20 minutes naturally

**Mental Health:**
- Suicidal ideation: completely absent
- Not a single instance since the flood dose
- Depression symptoms: absent
- Not managing depression—genuinely not experiencing it
- Anxiety: dissolved
- Baseline state is peace, not anxiety
- Panic attacks: none
- Not a single panic attack in 90+ days

**Nervous System:**
- Regulated
- Baseline state: calm presence
- Can experience stress without dysregulation
- Body feels safe for the first time
- Sleep, rest, and relaxation possible without substances

**Medications:**
- Off Zopiclone completely
- Tapering other medications under medical supervision
- No sleep medication, no anti-anxiety medication
- Working toward complete freedom from psychiatric medication

**Presence:**
- Authentically present with family
- Children notice and comment on the difference
- "Dad is actually here now"
- Can feel and express emotions
- Walls down—genuine connection possible

## The Evidence Trail

I know these claims sound dramatic. They are dramatic. That's why documentation matters.

**Sleep Tracking Data:**

I use a sleep tracking device that measures duration, sleep stages, and quality. The data shows:
- Pre-treatment: 3-4 hours average, minimal deep sleep
- Post-treatment: 7-8 hours average, 40-50% deep/REM

This is not subjective feeling. It's objective measurement.

**Medical Records:**

My medical team has documented:
- Successful tapering of sleep medication
- Stable mood without mood stabilizers
- No acute psychiatric episodes requiring intervention
- Overall improvement in all measured parameters

**Family Testimony:**

My wife Nancy, my children Perla and Maverick—they all report experiencing a different man. Not subtle differences. Fundamental differences.

"It's like he's actually here now," one of my children said.

"I can feel you when I'm with you," Nancy said. "I couldn't before."

## What Accounts for the Change?

The skeptic asks: could this be placebo? Wishful thinking? Temporary improvement?

Let me address each:

**Placebo:**

The placebo effect is real but typically diminishes over time. Ninety days later, the changes persist. Six months later (at the time of writing), they persist. The trajectory is sustained improvement, not temporary uplift followed by return to baseline.

Moreover, I had tried many interventions with high hope—countless therapies, medications, programs. Hope alone did not produce these results.

**Wishful Thinking:**

I am not interpreting my experience positively. The metrics are objective:
- Hours of sleep (measured)
- Presence of suicidal thoughts (reported honestly)
- Medication usage (documented)
- Family observations (external confirmation)

I am not claiming to feel better. I am documenting concrete changes.

**Temporary Improvement:**

The question is fair. Many treatments produce short-term gains.

But at six months, the changes persist. At a year (projected from trajectory), they are expected to persist. The pattern suggests structural change, not temporary elevation.

## The Internal Transformation

Beyond the measurable metrics, something else changed that is harder to quantify but no less real:

**Internal Suffering: Gone**

The constant background noise of psychological pain—present for as long as I could remember—is silent. Not numbed. Not managed. Absent.

I did not know life could feel this way.

I assumed that baseline suffering was universal. That everyone carried this weight. That the best I could hope for was management.

I was wrong.

Freedom from internal suffering is possible.

I am living it.

**Time Experience: Transformed**

Time feels different. Slower. Fuller.

Before, life was experienced through mental projection—rehearsing the past, anticipating the future. The present moment was almost never actually inhabited.

Now, time is experienced moment by moment. Each moment has texture, depth, presence.

I am no longer time-traveling. I am here.

**Identity: Grounded**

Love, validation, and acceptance are no longer sought externally.

For forty-five years, I was trying to earn these things through achievement, performance, relationship management. Now they are received directly from God, embodied internally, and expressed outwardly through overflow.

I no longer need external validation.

I know who I am.

## What This Means for You

I share these measurements not to boast but to provide evidence.

If you are suffering—if you are managing rather than healed, surviving rather than living—I want you to know that genuine transformation is possible.

Not just incremental improvement.

Not just better coping.

Fundamental change.

The metrics of your life can change:
- Sleep can be restored
- Suicidal thoughts can cease completely
- Anxiety can dissolve (not be managed—dissolve)
- Presence can become your baseline

I do not know what path leads to these changes for you. It may not look like mine.

But I want you to know the destination exists.

Freedom is not a theory.

It is measurable.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Don't settle for management.*

*Don't accept "better coping" as the ceiling of your healing.*

*Don't let anyone tell you that your suffering is permanent, that your symptoms are your identity, that the best you can hope for is living with your disease.*

*Transformation is real.*

*Complete change is possible.*

*The metrics of your life can shift dramatically—not through willpower, not through white-knuckling, but through genuine healing at the root.*

*Keep seeking.*

*Keep believing.*

*The evidence exists.*

*I am the evidence.*
