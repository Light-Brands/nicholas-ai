# Chapter Seven
## The Trinitarian Self

---

*"Dark Warrior, Light Warrior, Creator"*

---

During the integration season, a framework emerged that would become essential to my daily life.

I am not one thing.

I am three things in union.

This is the Trinitarian Self.

---

## The Revelation

The understanding came gradually, through prayer, reflection, and the continued processing of my sacred encounters.

Just as God is Trinity—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, three persons in perfect union—so we are made in that image. We are also trinitarian beings.

We have a body. We have a soul. We have a spirit.

These are not just theological categories. They are living realities, each with its own function, its own voice, its own wisdom.

Understanding them—and their proper relationship—is the key to integrated living.

## The Dark Warrior: Body

The first part of the Trinitarian Self is what I call the **Dark Warrior**.

The Dark Warrior is the body.

It is my humanity. My earthly vessel. The part of me that experiences time and sensation. The flesh.

The Dark Warrior is called "dark" not because it is evil, but because it operates in the seen realm—the realm of physical reality, which in spiritual terms is often called darkness compared to the uncreated light of God.

The Dark Warrior carries:
- Physical sensations
- Instincts and reflexes
- Biological needs and drives
- The nervous system's responses
- Stored trauma in the body

The Dark Warrior is not bad. It is a gift. Without the body, we could not experience this world, could not touch or taste or hold those we love.

But the Dark Warrior has limitations.

It seeks safety, comfort, and survival. Its time horizon is short. Its wisdom is important but incomplete. When the Dark Warrior leads, we live in constant reactivity—seeking pleasure, avoiding pain, managing threats.

## The Light Warrior: Soul

The second part of the Trinitarian Self is what I call the **Light Warrior**.

The Light Warrior is the soul.

The soul includes the mind, the will, and the emotions. It is the interpreter, the gatekeeper, the bridge between seen and unseen.

The Light Warrior is called "light" because it operates in the realm of thought, imagination, and meaning—the realm where we interpret our experience and make sense of the world.

The Light Warrior carries:
- Thoughts and beliefs
- Emotions and feelings
- Memory and narrative
- Will and decision
- Personality and identity

The Light Warrior is powerful. The mind can understand, plan, create. The will can choose, commit, persist. The emotions can motivate, connect, reveal.

But the Light Warrior also has limitations.

When the soul leads without guidance, we live in the chaos of emotions, the confusion of thoughts, the conflict of competing desires. The soul needs something higher to navigate by.

---

## The Creator: Spirit

The third part of the Trinitarian Self is what I call the **Creator**.

The Creator is the spirit.

The spirit is the part of us that exists in eternal union with God. It is untouched by time, unbound by circumstance. It is the deepest seat of our being—the place where we connect with the Holy Spirit.

The Creator is the source of:
- Divine guidance and wisdom
- Eternal perspective
- Peace that transcends understanding
- Joy that is not dependent on circumstances
- Communion with God

The Creator spirit is who we are at the deepest level.

Before trauma shaped us. Before covenants were made. Before wounds distorted our development.

The Creator spirit knows our true identity, our true calling, our true nature.

---

## The Union

These three are not separate beings. They are one self in union.

Just as the Trinity is three persons in one God, the human being is three aspects in one person.

But unlike the Trinity, which exists in perfect harmony, the human trinitarian self is often in conflict.

The body wants one thing (comfort, pleasure, safety).

The soul wants another (meaning, connection, achievement).

The spirit wants another still (union with God, eternal purpose, divine alignment).

When these are in conflict, we experience inner turmoil. When they are aligned, we experience peace and wholeness.

---

## The Integration of Three

Integration is the process of bringing the three into alignment.

This doesn't mean suppressing the body or ignoring the soul. Each part has legitimate needs and genuine wisdom.

The body's need for safety is real. The soul's need for meaning is real. The spirit's need for God is real.

Integration means honoring all three while establishing proper order.

**The Dark Warrior (body)** is honored by:
- Physical care (sleep, nutrition, exercise)
- Nervous system regulation
- Healing stored trauma in the body
- Respecting physical limits

**The Light Warrior (soul)** is honored by:
- Emotional processing
- Mind renewal through truth
- Will alignment with purpose
- Meaningful narrative and identity

**The Creator (spirit)** is honored by:
- Prayer and communion with God
- Spiritual practices that feed the spirit
- Living from eternal perspective
- Yielding to Holy Spirit guidance

---

## Practical Application

In daily life, I now consult all three.

When making a decision, I ask:
- What does my body tell me? (Physical wisdom—energy, health, sensation)
- What does my soul tell me? (Emotional wisdom—feelings, desires, concerns)
- What does my spirit tell me? (Spiritual wisdom—peace, alignment, divine guidance)

When there is conflict between the three, I bring them into dialogue.

Sometimes the body says "rest" while the soul says "push through." Sometimes the soul says "worry" while the spirit says "peace." Sometimes all three have different signals.

The goal is not to silence any voice but to achieve harmony through proper order.

## For Travelers

Understanding your trinitarian nature is essential for integrated living.

Most of us are dominated by one part:

**Body-dominant people** live primarily in physical reality—focused on comfort, pleasure, and survival. They may struggle with presence, meaning, and spiritual connection.

**Soul-dominant people** live primarily in mental and emotional reality—focused on thoughts, feelings, and achieving. They may struggle with physical health, embodiment, and spiritual surrender.

**Spirit-dominant people** may seem holy but can neglect body and soul—ignoring physical needs, suppressing emotions, "spiritualizing" everything. They may struggle with integration into daily life.

The goal is not dominance by any one part but **harmony of all three, with spirit leading**.

*Dear Traveler,*

*You are more than you realize.*

*Not one thing but three. Not simple but complex. Not fragmented but integrated—at least potentially.*

*Honor your body. It is the temple that carries you through this world.*

*Honor your soul. It is the interpreter that gives meaning to your experience.*

*Honor your spirit. It is the connection point with the eternal.*

*And learn to bring them into harmony.*

*When they work together, aligned in proper order, you will experience the wholeness you were designed for.*

*You are made in the image of the Trinity.*

*Learn to live as a trinitarian being.*
