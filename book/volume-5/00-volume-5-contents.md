### Volume Summary

This volume documents the critical ninety days following Nicholas's sacred encounter with ibogaine. It addresses the question every person who has had a profound spiritual experience must face: *How do I live what I've seen?*

Through the four booster doses, the return to Transcend for Bufo, and the daily work of integration, Nicholas discovers that revelation is only the beginning. The real transformation happens when the insights from the sacred encounter are translated into ordinary life.

The Trinitarian Self framework—understanding ourselves as Body (Dark Warrior), Soul (Light Warrior), and Spirit (Creator)—provides the architecture for integrated living. The Divine Order—Spirit leads Soul leads Body—provides the operating system.

And the Baptism of Love—finally feeling Nancy's pain after seventeen years of marriage—proves that the transformation is real.
