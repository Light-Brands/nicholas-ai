# Chapter Three
## The Vertical Awakening

*"5-MeO-DMT, Unity Consciousness, Eternal Truth Revealed"*

---

Bufo alvarius.

The Sonoran Desert toad. A humble creature that secretes a substance containing 5-MeO-DMT—what some call "the God molecule."

On a November morning in Cancun, I inhaled it.

And for fifteen minutes—or fifteen eternities, time being unreliable in these spaces—I experienced something that language cannot capture.

I will try anyway.

---

## The Preparation

The Bufo ceremony was different from the ibogaine protocol.

Ibogaine is ingested orally and unfolds over twenty-four to forty-eight hours. Bufo is inhaled and peaks within minutes. The duration is brief—typically fifteen to thirty minutes of primary experience—but the intensity is beyond comparison.

The guides prepared me.

"Bufo is not like ibogaine. There is no narrative. No visions in the traditional sense. No processing of memories or relationships."

I nodded, not really understanding.

"Bufo is the experience of unity. The dissolution of the separate self. For a brief time, you will not experience yourself as Nicholas. You will experience yourself as... everything. As nothing. As God."

They warned me that the experience could be overwhelming. That surrender was essential. That resistance would only intensify the dissolution.

"Your ego will try to hold on. Let it go. It will come back."

I lay down on the mat they had prepared. The guide held the pipe containing the medicine.

"When you're ready, inhale fully and hold as long as you can."

I was ready.

I inhaled.

## The Dissolution

What happened next cannot be adequately described.

The moment the smoke entered my lungs, reality began to dissolve.

Not gradually—instantly.

The room disappeared. My body disappeared. The concept of "Nicholas" disappeared. The boundary between self and other—the fundamental assumption underlying all human experience—vanished.

There was no "I" experiencing something.

There was only experience.

Pure awareness. Infinite presence. Unbounded consciousness without any center.

---

## Unity

The word "unity" is used often in spiritual contexts. It rarely captures what I experienced.

This was not the feeling of connection with others.

This was the end of separation at the most fundamental level.

I was not connected to everything—I *was* everything.

The stars and the ocean and the earth and every being that had ever existed or would ever exist—all of it was one thing. One consciousness. One being.

And that being was God.

And I was not separate from God.

I was in God and God was in me and there was no meaningful distinction between these.

---

## The Nature of Time

In this state, time did not exist.

Not "time moved slowly" or "time felt different."

*Time did not exist.*

There was no past. No future. Only an eternal present moment that contained all moments.

Every experience I had ever had, every experience I would ever have—all simultaneously present. All now.

The human mind categorizes experience into before and after. In unity consciousness, these categories collapse.

Everything that has ever happened and will ever happen is always happening.

We experience it as sequence only because our brains cannot process simultaneity.

But the deeper reality is timeless.

---

## God

I hesitate to write this.

I know how it sounds. I know the theological problems. I know the arrogance it might seem to imply.

But I have to tell the truth:

I experienced what I can only call God.

Not as an external being I was encountering.

As the ground of all being, in which I was held.

The infinite love that I had heard about in church my whole life—I experienced it. Not as an emotion. As the fabric of existence. As the fundamental nature of reality itself.

Everything is made of love.

Everything is held by love.

Love is not something God does.

Love is what God *is*.

And in those fifteen minutes or fifteen eternities, I was not separate from that love. I was it, and it was me, and we were all things, and all things were one.

---

## The Return

At some point—and I cannot tell you how long it took, because duration had no meaning—the dissolution began to reverse.

The boundaries began to reform.

First, awareness of body. Sensations returning. The feeling of lying on something solid.

Then, awareness of self. Nicholas. This person. This life. These memories.

Then, awareness of environment. The room. The guides. The sounds.

Like a watercolor painting slowly gaining definition, I coalesced back into individual existence.

I opened my eyes.

I was crying.

Not from sadness—from the sheer overwhelm of having experienced something that the human mind is not designed to contain.

---

## What It Revealed

The Bufo experience did not teach me things in the way ibogaine did.

There were no visions to interpret. No narratives to process. No specific insights to integrate.

Instead, it revealed something underneath all insights:

**I am not a human searching for God.**

**I am an eternal spirit, animated by God, living a human experience.**

This is not just theology. Not just belief.

It is something I *know* now, at a level deeper than belief.

I have tasted it. I have been it.

The eternal kingdom is not somewhere else, waiting for us after death.

It is here. Now. Within.

We have access to it in every moment.

We just forget.

---

## The Atmosphere of God

In the Bufo experience, I encountered what I can only call the atmosphere of God.

Certain qualities were not just present—they were the medium in which everything existed:

**Infinite love.** Not conditional, not earned. Love as the fundamental reality.

**Peace.** Not absence of conflict but presence of wholeness. Peace as the ground state.

**Stillness.** Movement happened within it, but the stillness itself was unmoved. The eye of the hurricane.

**Presence.** No past pulling backward, no future pulling forward. Eternal now.

**Oneness.** No separation. All things one thing.

These were not emotional states I was experiencing.

They were **ontological realities**—the very nature of God Himself.

---

## The Compass

After the Bufo experience, I carry something I can only call a compass.

I have been there. I have experienced the unity, the timelessness, the infinite love.

I can never un-know that.

When I forget—when I descend into lower states of consciousness, into survival mode, into separation and fear—I still know that the higher state exists.

I have a reference point now.

I can always return.

Not by taking Bufo again (though I may). But by remembering. By choosing presence. By returning to the breath, the moment, the awareness beneath all thoughts.

The garden is not elsewhere.

It is here.

It is now.

It is within.

*Dear Traveler,*

*I do not know if Bufo is part of your path.*

*What I know is this: the unity I experienced is not reserved for special people or special substances. It is the fundamental nature of reality.*

*Mystics throughout history have described this same experience—through meditation, through prayer, through fasting, through grace.*

*The separation we experience—the sense of being isolated individuals in a hostile universe—is an illusion.*

*A useful illusion. A necessary illusion for navigating human life.*

*But an illusion nonetheless.*

*Beneath all the noise of the human experience, there is a stillness.*

*Within that stillness is infinite love.*

*And you are not separate from it.*

*You never were.*
