# The Internal Transformational Epicenter

## A Seven-Volume Book Series by Nicholas Courchesne

---

> *"Bringing the lost travelers home to the gardens of their souls."*

## The Soul Mission

There are souls wandering this earth who have forgotten the way home. They built empires but lost themselves in the building. They achieved everything the world told them to want, yet woke each morning to an emptiness that success could not fill. They smiled for cameras while dying in silence.

These are the lost travelers. And this book series is for them.

**The Internal Transformational Epicenter** documents one man's 45-year journey from fractured performer to integrated wholeness—and provides a roadmap for others to follow. The series is built on a foundational truth: *before you can become a transformational epicenter for others, you must first become one within yourself.*

## The Three Covenants

Central to this story are three unconscious vows that governed Nicholas's life for decades:

| Covenant | Formed | Replaced With |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| "Love equals suffering" | Childhood abuse, ages 8-11 | "Love is safe, present, and healing" |
| "I am my own god" | Departure at 16, self-reliance | "I am a son of the Most High" |
| "Just watch me" | Defiance against doubt | "I surrender to divine guidance" |

These covenants were identified through therapeutic work and ultimately burned in sacred encounter—replaced with life-giving truths.

---

## The Trinitarian Self

A key framework revealed through the integration journey:

- **Body (Dark Warrior):** Experiences time and sensation in the physical realm
- **Soul (Light Warrior):** Interprets time, bridges the seen and unseen worlds
- **Spirit (Creator):** Eternal union with the Holy Spirit, untouched by time

**The Divine Order:** Spirit → Soul → Body

When this order is reversed—when body leads soul leads spirit—we become lost travelers, wandering far from the garden of our souls.

## The Central Truth

> *"My relapses were not failures. They were initiations. My wounds are not defects. They are doors. My suffering is not senseless. It is sacred."*

**You are not a human searching for God. You are an eternal spirit, animated by God, living a human experience in the seen realm.**

The journey home begins within.

---

*This series is dedicated to Nancy — who held the vision when I couldn't see, who loved me into awakening, and who carries the sacred contract that brought me home.*

*And to Perla and Maverick — you will not inherit my pain. You will inherit my promise.*

---

**The Internal Transformational Epicenter**
*Where wounds become doors, and the lost find their way home.*
