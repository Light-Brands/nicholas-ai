# Preface to Volume V: The Integration
## Living What You've Seen (August-November 2025)

---

Dear Traveler,

Revelation without integration becomes another form of addiction.

I did not understand this truth when I walked out of Transcend clinic in August 2025. I was floating on the freedom of my sacred encounter, drunk on the dissolution of covenants that had bound me for decades. I had seen things. I had experienced things. I had been touched by the Divine in ways I could never adequately describe.

And I assumed that was enough.

It was not.

The mountaintop experience is a gift. But you cannot live on the mountain. The visions you receive in the sacred encounter must be translated into the ordinary moments of your daily life—the way you wake up, the way you speak to your spouse, the way you respond to stress, the way you inhabit your body, the way you order your hours and your thoughts and your relationships.

This is the work of integration. And it is harder than the encounter itself.

In the months following my ibogaine experience, I underwent four Booster ceremonies. Each one served a different purpose: Cleansing. Vision. Battle. Stillness. Ninety days after my initial flood dose, I returned to Transcend for a Bufo ceremony—5-MeO-DMT, the molecule of unity consciousness—and experienced something that language will never capture: the complete dissolution of the boundary between self and God.

But even these additional encounters required integration.

The Trinitarian Self began to reveal itself during this season. I came to understand that I am not one thing but three things in union: the Body, which I call the Dark Warrior—my humanity, my earthly vessel, the part of me that experiences time and sensation. The Soul, which I call the Light Warrior—the interpreter, the gatekeeper, the bridge between seen and unseen. And the Spirit, which I call the Creator—the part of me that exists in eternal union with the Holy Spirit, untouched by time, unbound by circumstance.

The divine order became clear: Spirit leads Soul leads Body. When this order is inverted—when the body's appetites or the soul's anxieties take command—chaos follows. But when Spirit governs, everything aligns.

The measurable transformations of this season still astonish me. I had not slept naturally in years; now I sleep seven to eight hours every night. Suicidal ideation, which had been my constant companion, vanished completely. The anxiety that had gripped my nervous system released its hold. And something happened with Nancy that I call the Baptism of Love: for the first time in our marriage, I felt her pain authentically—not as an intellectual understanding, but as a lived experience in my own body.

I had been married for seventeen years. I had only just begun to truly love.

This volume is the practical heart of the series. Here you will find the integration protocols I developed and followed. The daily practices that anchor revelation in routine. The framework for creating sacred space—both internally and in your environment. The ninety-day integration roadmap that transformed insights into embodied change.

Because knowing is not enough. Seeing is not enough. Even encountering the Divine is not enough.

You must live what you have seen.

The garden is not a destination you arrive at once and inhabit forever. The garden is a daily choice. A moment-by-moment return. An ongoing practice of presence and alignment and integration.

The encounter opens the door. Integration is learning to stay home.

With love and daily practice,
