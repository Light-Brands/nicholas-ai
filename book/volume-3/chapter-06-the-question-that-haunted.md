# Chapter Six
## The Question That Haunted

---

*"Why Can't I Heal?"*

---

Throughout the entire dark night, one question haunted me more than any other.

Not *Why did this happen?* That question had answers, even if they were painful.

Not *When will this end?* That question implied hope I couldn't always access.

The question that kept me awake, that followed me into the hospital, that whispered during my relapses, that I could never escape was this:

*Why can't I heal?*

---

## The Inventory of Effort

I had tried everything.

Let me be specific about what "everything" meant:

**Twelve-step programs.** AA, NA, ACA—the anonymous fellowships that had saved my life in the beginning. Hundreds of meetings. Multiple sponsors. Steps worked thoroughly and repeatedly.

**Therapy.** Individual. Group. Couples. Various modalities. Cognitive behavioral. Psychodynamic. Trauma-focused. Years of sessions. Thousands of hours.

**Medication.** Mood stabilizers, antidepressants, anti-anxiety medications, sleep aids. Every combination the psychiatrists could devise. Some helped temporarily. None healed.

**Hospitalization.** Multiple admissions. ECT. Intensive outpatient programs. The full arsenal of psychiatric intervention.

**Alternative approaches.** Meditation. Breathwork. Yoga. Fasting. Prayer retreats. Self-help books. Seminars. Workshops.

**Spiritual practices.** Daily prayer. Scripture reading. Church attendance. Spiritual direction.

I had done the work. I had followed the protocols. I had surrendered, at least as much as I understood surrender.

And yet.

Here I was. Still broken. Still cycling. Still on the edge of destruction.

## The Despair of "Everything"

There is a particular despair that comes when you've tried everything and nothing has worked.

It's not the despair of someone who hasn't tried—that person can still hold hope that trying might help.

It's the despair of exhausted options. The sense that you've run the full gauntlet of available treatments and come out the other side unchanged.

What do you do when everything has failed?

Where do you turn when every door has closed?

This was the question I couldn't answer. And its unanswerable nature fed the whispers of death.

*You're unfixable.*

*Some people are too broken.*

*Your wounds are too deep.*

*Your demons are too strong.*

---

## The Missing Piece

What I couldn't see—what would only become clear much later—was that I hadn't actually tried everything.

I had tried everything *within a certain framework*. The framework of conventional medicine. The framework of mainstream recovery. The framework of Western approaches to mental health.

Within that framework, I had been thorough. I had been compliant. I had done the work.

But the framework itself was limited.

Conventional psychiatry treated symptoms. It didn't heal wounds.

Twelve-step programs managed addiction. They didn't break covenants.

Talk therapy addressed patterns. It didn't touch what was stored in my body, in my nervous system, in the depths of my unconscious.

I had been working hard within a box that was too small to contain my healing.

---

## The Wound Beneath

What I would eventually understand is this:

I had been treating the wrong thing.

The depression, the mania, the addiction, the relapses—these were not the problem. They were *symptoms* of the problem.

The problem was the wound.

The problem was the eight-year-old boy who was violated and fractured and made covenants in his pain.

The problem was a nervous system that never learned safety.

The problem was an identity built on performance because the authentic self had been too wounded to function.

Until I addressed the wound—not managed it, but healed it—the symptoms would continue.

This seems obvious in retrospect. But in the midst of the dark night, I couldn't see it.

I kept treating what was visible. The invisible remained hidden.

---

## The Covenants Still Running

Throughout all my efforts at healing, the three covenants were still operating.

**Love equals suffering.**

Despite therapy. Despite marriage. Despite recovery. I still fundamentally believed that love was dangerous. That intimacy would lead to pain. That protecting myself from vulnerability was essential.

This covenant kept me at arm's length from Nancy, from God, from anyone who might truly know me.

**I am my own god.**

Despite prayers. Despite surrender language. Despite spiritual practices. I still fundamentally believed that I had to save myself. That relying on others was weakness. That control was safety.

This covenant kept me from receiving the help that was available.

**Just watch me.**

Despite the collapse of my career. Despite the proof that achievement couldn't heal me. I still fundamentally believed that proving myself was the answer. That if I could just succeed at recovery, at therapy, at being healed—if I could perform wellness the way I had performed success—everything would be fine.

This covenant kept me trying harder instead of surrendering deeper.

## The Preparation

What I understand now is that the question *Why can't I heal?* was itself preparation.

The despair of exhausted options was necessary. It was breaking my certainty that I knew the answer. It was opening space for approaches I would have dismissed in my previous state.

I needed to reach the end of my resources before I could receive something beyond them.

I needed to fail completely at saving myself before I could be saved.

The question haunted me because it was doing its work. It was demolishing the last fortress of self-reliance. It was preparing the ground for what would come.

---

## The Glimmer Ahead

In the depths of this haunting question, something began to stir.

Whispers of a different kind. Not the whispers of death—but whispers of possibility.

I began hearing about plant medicine. About ibogaine. About people who had tried everything—just like me—and found healing in a matter of days that years of therapy couldn't provide.

I was skeptical. I was also desperate.

The desperation would prove to be a gift.

Because desperation is what breaks open the closed mind.

Desperation is what makes room for the impossible.

And what was coming was impossible—by every metric I had for measuring reality.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you've tried everything and nothing has worked, I see you.*

*The exhaustion of failed attempts. The despair of closed doors. The haunting question: Why can't I heal?*

*I want to offer you something:*

*The fact that you haven't healed yet doesn't mean you can't heal.*

*It may mean that the path to your healing lies outside the framework you've been working within.*

*There are approaches you haven't tried. Not because you haven't been thorough, but because you didn't know they existed. Or because you dismissed them. Or because they seemed too unconventional, too risky, too far outside what you thought was possible.*

*Your desperation is not weakness. It's preparation.*

*It's breaking open the closed certainties that have kept you trapped.*

*It's making room for something you can't yet imagine.*

*Keep asking the question.*

*Keep seeking.*

*The answer exists.*

*You just haven't found it yet.*
