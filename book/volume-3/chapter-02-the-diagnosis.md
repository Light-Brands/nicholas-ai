# Chapter Two
## The Diagnosis

---

*Bipolar Type 2*

---

The symptoms had always been there.

The racing thoughts that wouldn't stop. The periods of boundless energy followed by crushing depression. The insomnia that plagued me since childhood. The emotional volatility that I had learned to mask with alcohol and later with achievement.

For decades, I had called these things by other names:

*Drive. Ambition. Intensity. Passion.*

They were the fuel of my success. The engine of my performance. The energy that allowed me to outwork everyone else.

Now, in the wreckage of my career, they had a different name.

**Bipolar Disorder Type 2.**

## The Unraveling

Within months of losing my position, my mental health deteriorated rapidly.

The symptoms that had always lurked beneath the surface erupted:

**Racing thoughts** that refused to stop. Not productive planning—just noise. An endless loop of catastrophizing, replaying, analyzing, worrying. The brain that had been my greatest asset now felt like an enemy.

**Insomnia** so severe that sleep became a distant memory. Three hours. Two hours. Sometimes none. And the less I slept, the worse everything else became.

**Grandiosity** that would surge without warning. Suddenly I would believe I had the answer to everything. That I could solve any problem. That I was destined for something enormous. These weren't normal confidence—they were delusion dressed in ambition.

**Impulsivity** that led to decisions I couldn't explain even to myself. Spending money we didn't have. Making calls I shouldn't make. Acting on urges that made no sense.

**Emotional volatility** that turned me into a stranger to myself. Rage that appeared from nowhere. Tears that came without reason. A complete inability to regulate what I was feeling.

**Depression** that descended like a fog and stayed for days. Not sadness—something deeper. A heaviness that made getting out of bed feel impossible. A grayness that drained color from everything.

**Episodes of hypomania** where sleep seemed unnecessary, where ideas flowed too fast to capture, where I felt invincible—until the crash.

The executive who had managed million-dollar deals couldn't now manage his own mind.

## The Psychiatrist's Office

Nancy finally convinced me to see a psychiatrist.

I sat in the office, trying to describe what was happening. The symptoms. The patterns. The family history of mental illness that I had tried to ignore.

The psychiatrist listened. Asked questions. Made notes.

And then delivered the words that would change everything—and nothing:

"Mr. Courchesne, you have Bipolar Disorder Type 2."

There it was. A label. A diagnosis. A clinical explanation for the chaos.

## Understanding Bipolar Type 2

Bipolar Type 2 is different from the more commonly known Bipolar Type 1.

Type 1 features full manic episodes—extended periods of extreme elevation where people might not sleep for days, might spend all their money, might make decisions with catastrophic consequences.

Type 2 features hypomania—a less intense but still elevated state—alternating with significant depression.

The cruel irony of Type 2 is that hypomania often feels good. It feels like finally being yourself. Productive, creative, energetic. You don't want it to stop.

And so people with Type 2 often go undiagnosed for years—even decades—because the "good" periods feel like health, not illness.

I had been hypomanic many times in my life. I just called it "being on." Being in the zone. Being at my best.

Now I understood that my "best" was actually a symptom.

---

## The Medications

The psychiatrist wrote prescriptions:

**Mood stabilizers** to even out the swings between up and down.

**Antidepressants** to address the crushing lows.

**Sleep aids** to force the rest my brain refused to take.

**Anti-anxiety medications** to quiet the constant agitation.

I took them as prescribed. For a time, they helped.

The swings became less severe. The insomnia partially lifted. The edge of the agitation softened.

But something else happened too.

I felt numbed.

Not better—numbed.

---

## The Numbness

The medications didn't heal me. They managed me.

They put a chemical ceiling on my highs and a floor under my lows. They kept me in a narrow band of functionality.

But they also cut me off from myself.

I couldn't feel joy. I couldn't feel sorrow. I couldn't feel much of anything beyond a gray neutrality.

The emotions I had been trying to access for years—the grief, the anger, the love, the hope—all of it became muffled. Like trying to hear music through a thick wall.

I was stable. I was also hollow.

---

## The Disconnect

The medication created a disconnect that was deeply disturbing.

I felt separated from God. The prayers that used to feel like connection now felt like talking to a wall. The spiritual practices that had sustained me felt empty.

I felt separated from Nancy and the children. I could perform presence, but I couldn't feel it. I could say "I love you" without accessing the love.

I felt separated from myself. There was a me somewhere behind the chemical fog, but I couldn't reach him.

This was better than the chaos. But it wasn't living.

---

## The Question Forms

A question began to form during this medicated season:

*Is this the best I can hope for?*

A managed life. A stable but numbed existence. Chemicals keeping the chaos at bay while also keeping me from fully living.

Was this my future? Decades of pharmaceutical maintenance? The edge taken off the highs, the floor put under the lows, and the full spectrum of human experience inaccessible?

I understood why the medications were necessary. I had seen what happened without them. The spiral. The hospitalizations. The destruction.

But I also knew this wasn't healing. This was maintenance.

And somewhere deep inside—deeper than the chemicals could reach—I believed there had to be more.

## What the Diagnosis Explained

Despite its limitations, the diagnosis did provide something valuable: explanation.

Looking back at my life through the lens of Bipolar Type 2, so much made sense:

**The periods of extraordinary productivity** that had built my businesses. These weren't just hard work—they were hypomanic episodes, states of elevated energy and grandiosity that drove me to accomplish things that normal-functioning people couldn't.

**The crashes that followed every success.** Every major achievement was followed by a period of collapse. I had thought this was just exhaustion. Now I understood it was the depressive phase that follows elevation.

**The impulsive decisions** that had cost me relationships, money, and trust. Not moral failures alone—symptoms of a brain that couldn't regulate itself.

**The insomnia** that had plagued me since childhood. Not poor sleep hygiene—a brain that wouldn't shut off.

**The addiction** that had nearly killed me. Not just a disease of choice—self-medication for a condition I didn't know I had.

The diagnosis didn't excuse my behavior. But it explained it. And explanation was a starting point for something more.

---

## The Limits of the Label

But here is what the diagnosis could not do:

It could not tell me why.

Why had my brain developed this way? The answer, I would eventually learn, was trauma. The abuse. The covenants. The nervous system that never learned safety.

It could not heal the wound.

Medications could manage symptoms. But the underlying fracture—the shattered identity, the covenants operating in darkness—remained untouched.

It could not give me back myself.

The label told me what was wrong. It didn't tell me who I really was beneath the wrongness.

---

## A Necessary Step

Despite its limits, the diagnosis was a necessary step.

I needed to understand that something was clinically wrong with my brain. I needed the medications to create enough stability for the deeper work to eventually happen.

Without the diagnosis and the initial medication, I might not have survived to receive the healing that would come later.

The dark night required me to pass through this phase. Not to stay here—but to pass through.

The numbness would not be permanent.

The disconnect would not last forever.

There was another way ahead.

I just couldn't see it yet.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you carry a diagnosis—bipolar, depression, anxiety, PTSD—I want to speak directly to you.*

*The diagnosis is not your identity.*

*The diagnosis is a description of symptoms. It is a label that helps clinicians communicate and provides access to treatment. It may be accurate. It may be useful.*

*But it is not who you are.*

*You are not a disorder. You are a human being experiencing a disorder. The distinction matters.*

*The medications may be necessary. Take them if they help. Work with professionals who can guide you. Don't let anyone shame you for doing what you need to do to survive.*

*But also know: survival is not the goal. Transformation is.*

*The medications can create stability. They cannot create wholeness.*

*Somewhere beyond the diagnosis, beyond the symptoms, beyond the chemical management—there is a you that is waiting to be discovered.*

*Don't stop at the label.*

*Keep going.*
