# Chapter Four
## The Relapses

---

*Eight Years Shattered*

---

The first drink after eight years of sobriety felt like coming home.

And it felt like dying.

Both at once.

---

## The Moment

I don't remember exactly when it happened. The timeline of the dark night is blurred—one crisis bleeding into another until the details lose their edges.

But I remember the feeling.

The familiar warmth spreading through my body. The chemical relief washing over my nervous system. The temporary cessation of the screaming inside my skull.

I remember thinking: *Ah. There you are. I've missed you.*

The addiction welcoming me back. The old lover who never forgot my address.

---

## The Shame

The shame arrived before the hangover.

Eight years. Two thousand nine hundred twenty days without a drink. Countless meetings attended. Steps worked. Sponsees sponsored. Stories shared about the miracle of recovery.

And now this.

I had betrayed everything I stood for. Everyone who believed in me. Every testimony I had given about the power of sobriety.

The shame was physical—a weight on my chest, a nausea in my stomach that had nothing to do with alcohol.

I had proven what I had always secretly feared: I was fundamentally broken. Unfixable. A fraud.

---

## The Pattern

That first relapse was not a single drink.

It became days. A week. Longer.

The same pattern from before I got sober: drinking to manage the drinking. Drinking to quiet the shame of drinking. Drinking because stopping seemed impossible.

Then something would pull me back. Nancy's face. The children's confusion. The whisper of that voice that had never fully died—the one that said *there is more, this is not who you are.*

I would stop. Crawl back to meetings. Call my sponsor in shame. Reset the counter to Day One.

And then, weeks or months later, another trigger. Another spiral. Another relapse.

The eight years weren't erased—they had happened. But they no longer felt real. They felt like a performance I had managed to sustain, now revealed to have been hollow all along.

## What the Relapses Revealed

Here is what I would eventually understand about these relapses:

**They were not the cause of my crisis. They were a symptom.**

The drinking wasn't the problem. The drinking was an attempt to solve the problem—a desperate, destructive, ultimately failed attempt to manage pain that I couldn't otherwise bear.

**They revealed what sobriety had been hiding.**

For eight years, I had been "sober." But I had been running—from the wound, from the covenants, from the little boy frozen in shame. Sobriety had given me the capacity to run faster and farther. But I was still running.

The relapses happened when I ran out of road. When the career collapsed and the identity shattered and there was nowhere left to run, the running stopped. And what I had been running from caught up with me.

Alcohol was the only tool I had to face what caught me. It was a terrible tool. But it was the only one I knew.

**They were, paradoxically, initiations.**

I know this sounds like excuse-making. It isn't. I'm not minimizing the destruction the relapses caused—to myself, to Nancy, to my children.

But I now understand that each relapse drove me deeper into the darkness. And the darkness, I would eventually learn, was where the covenants lived. The darkness was where transformation would eventually happen.

I could not have reached the depths required for genuine healing without falling all the way down.

The relapses were rungs on a ladder descending into the abyss.

And the abyss was where God was waiting.

## The Reaction of Others

The recovery community, for all its wisdom, often struggles with relapse.

Some people were compassionate. They had been there. They understood that addiction is not a linear journey.

Others pulled away. The man they had looked up to—the sponsor, the speaker, the success story—had failed. And his failure made them question their own sobriety.

I lost friendships during this season. People who couldn't reconcile the Nicholas they thought they knew with the Nicholas who was drinking again.

I don't blame them. They were protecting their own recovery. They were doing what they needed to do.

But it hurt.

---

## Nancy's Impossible Position

Each relapse placed Nancy in an impossible position.

She had committed to loving me through anything. But "anything" was proving to be more than anyone should have to bear.

She had to decide: When do I help, and when do I step back? When is my support enabling, and when is it essential? Where is the line between unconditional love and self-destruction?

I watched her struggle with these questions. I watched her reach limits she didn't know she had. I watched her cry in ways I had never seen—not just sad tears, but the tears of someone whose heart is being crushed by the weight of another person's disease.

And I could do nothing. I was the one causing the pain. I was the one making the impossible choices necessary. I was the one forcing her into positions no spouse should ever face.

---

## The Gifts in the Wreckage

I hate talking about "gifts" in the context of relapse. It feels like minimizing the destruction.

But there were gifts. Terrible, costly gifts that I wouldn't have received any other way.

**Humility.** The arrogance of eight years of sobriety was burned away. I was no longer the recovery success story who could sponsor others from a position of strength. I was a broken man who had proved that no amount of sobriety automatically means healing.

**Desperation.** True desperation—the kind that breaks your willingness to keep trying the same things. The kind that opens you to options you would never have considered. The kind that eventually led me to Ibogaine.

**Clarity about what wasn't working.** The relapses proved that my previous approach—sobriety plus achievement plus performance—was not enough. Something fundamental had to change. The relapse cleared away any illusions about that.

---

## The Bottom of the Bottom

Each relapse took me lower than the last.

Not in terms of duration or severity—the relapses were actually briefer than my pre-recovery drinking. But in terms of internal devastation, each one cut deeper.

I was reaching the bottom of the bottom. The place where no more running was possible. The place where the only options were transformation or death.

I didn't know it then, but I was being prepared for something I couldn't imagine.

The relapses were stripping away everything that didn't serve the journey ahead.

They were brutal teachers. And their lessons would prove essential.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you have relapsed—after days or months or years of sobriety—I need to tell you something:*

*You are not a failure.*

*The relapse is not proof that you can't recover. It is not evidence of moral weakness. It is not the final word on your story.*

*Relapse is common. Statistics vary, but the majority of people attempting recovery experience at least one relapse. For many, multiple relapses are part of the journey.*

*This doesn't mean relapse is okay or that it shouldn't be taken seriously. The destruction is real. The consequences are real. The need to stop is real.*

*But relapse is not the end.*

*It is information. It reveals what isn't working. It exposes wounds that haven't healed. It creates desperation that can fuel genuine change.*

*The question is not: Did you relapse?*

*The question is: What will you do with what the relapse revealed?*

*Keep going.*

*The path is not a straight line.*

*But it still leads somewhere.*
