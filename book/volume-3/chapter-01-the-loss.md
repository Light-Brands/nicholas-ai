# Chapter One
## The Loss

---

*The Aftermath of February 26, 2018*

---

In the weeks that followed the elimination of my position, I learned what loss really means.

Not the loss of money—though that was real.
Not the loss of title—though that was devastating.
Not the loss of team or purpose or lifestyle—though each of those carved its own wound.

The real loss was this: I discovered I didn't know who I was.

And that discovery was worse than anything I had ever experienced—including the psychosis, including the near-death in the snowstorm, including the years of active addiction.

Because at least in those moments, I knew who I was. I was a mess, but I was a recognizable mess. I was Nicholas Courchesne, the prodigal, the performer, the achiever who had temporarily fallen.

Now I was no one.

## The Inventory of Absence

In the first days, I kept making mental inventories of what was gone.

**The $7.9 million in stock options.**

Not lost in a market crash. Not stolen or defrauded. Simply... irrelevant. Because stock options require employment to vest, and I was no longer employed.

Years of work. Years of sacrifice. Years of believing I was building a financial future.

Erased in a single conversation.

**The title.**

Vice President of Sales at Ideal Protein.

I had introduced myself with those words thousands of times. They had become my name. My identity. The first thing people knew about me.

Now I was Nicholas Courchesne... nothing.

**The team.**

Twenty people I had led. Trained. Mentored. Built relationships with over years.

They were still at the company. I was not. The relationships that felt like family were now severed by corporate structure.

**The purpose.**

I had believed I was transforming lives. Helping people lose weight. Improving health outcomes. Contributing to something that mattered.

Now I contributed to nothing.

**The lifestyle.**

First-class flights. Private jets. Five-star hotels. Expense accounts. The trappings of success that had become so normal I barely noticed them.

Gone.

All of it, gone.

## The Confusion

I was so confused.

The formula was supposed to work. Stay sober. Work hard. Prove yourself. Build something. Succeed.

I had followed the formula perfectly. Eight years without a drink. Countless hours of work. Undeniable achievement.

And the formula had failed me.

Or had I failed the formula?

The confusion was maddening. I replayed every decision, every meeting, every conversation. What could I have done differently? Where had I gone wrong?

The answer that slowly emerged was more devastating than any particular mistake:

There was nothing I could have done.

The reorganization was structural. My position was eliminated because of corporate strategy, not personal performance.

This meant my success and my failure were both illusions. I had controlled nothing. The achievement I had built my identity upon was built on sand that could shift without warning.

---

## The Void

In the space where my identity used to be, there was nothing.

Not peace—that would come later.
Not clarity—that required work I hadn't done yet.
Not even the familiar chaos of active addiction—that was still to come.

Just emptiness. A void. The absolute absence of self.

I would sit in the house for hours, unable to move. Unable to think coherently. Unable to answer the question Nancy kept gently asking: "What do you want to do today?"

I didn't know what I wanted to do today because I didn't know who I was. How can a non-person have desires? How can a void have preferences?

The high-functioning executive who had managed teams and flown private jets couldn't now decide whether to have coffee or tea.

---

## What I Had Lost Without Knowing

The material losses were obvious. The identity loss was devastating. But there was something else—something I couldn't name until much later.

I had lost my medication.

Not pharmaceutical medication—I hadn't been on those yet. I mean the medication of achievement. The drug of productivity. The numbing agent of constant performance.

For decades, I had been self-medicating with success. Every closed deal, every speaking engagement, every corporate victory—these were doses of a substance that kept the inner pain at bay.

Now the supply had been cut off.

And the pain that had always been there—the abuse, the covenants, the wounded child—came flooding back with nothing to block it.

The loss of the job was not the cause of my coming collapse. It was the removal of the last barrier between me and wounds I had never faced.

## Nancy's Strength

Through these early weeks, Nancy did what Nancy always did: she held everything together.

She managed the household while I sat in paralysis. She explained to the children that Daddy was going through a hard time. She fielded calls from concerned friends and family. She handled the practical chaos of sudden income loss.

And she sat with me.

She didn't try to fix me—she knew by now that I couldn't be fixed by platitudes. She didn't push me to "get back out there" or "find something new"—she understood that something fundamental had broken.

She just sat. Present. Patient. Holding space for a collapse she couldn't prevent.

Later, I would understand the cost of this to her. The strain on her own wellbeing. The weight she carried while I was incapable of carrying anything.

In the moment, I was too lost to see it.

## The Mask Removed

For thirty years, I had worn the mask of Nick.

The charming entrepreneur. The high-flying executive. The man who had everything together. The prodigal who came home and made good.

The mask was constructed to protect the wounded boy inside—the one who had been abused, the one whose heart was shattered, the one who vowed never to be vulnerable again.

And the mask worked. For thirty years, it worked brilliantly.

But now the mask had been ripped off.

Not by choice—by circumstance. The title that justified the mask was gone. The achievements that validated the mask were erased. The lifestyle that proved the mask's success had vanished.

What remained was what the mask had been protecting:

A terrified child who didn't know how to exist without performing.

A wounded soul who had never healed, only hidden.

An empty man who had everything except himself.

## The Questions Begin

In the silence of those first weeks, questions surfaced that I had never allowed myself to ask.

*Who am I without my title?*

I didn't know.

*Who am I without my achievements?*

I didn't know.

*Who am I without something to prove?*

I didn't know.

*Who am I?*

I. Didn't. Know.

These questions would haunt me through the coming years. They would drive me to hospitalizations, to medications, to relapses, to the edge of suicide.

But they would also drive me to transformation.

Because you cannot become who you really are until you stop being who you thought you were.

And who I thought I was had just died.

## The End and the Beginning

The loss of February 26, 2018 was the end of one story.

The story of proving myself.
The story of building identity from achievement.
The story of the mask and the performance.

But it was also the beginning of another story.

The story of dismantling.
The story of darkness.
The story of death that precedes resurrection.

I didn't know it then. I only knew that everything I had built was gone, and I was left holding the rubble.

What I would eventually learn is that the rubble was necessary. You cannot build something new until the old structure is cleared away. You cannot construct on a new foundation until the sand has shifted and the towers have fallen.

The loss was not punishment. It was preparation.

The dark night was beginning.

And it would last far longer than I could have imagined.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Have you experienced a loss that stripped away your identity?*

*A job that defined you, suddenly gone?*
*A relationship that gave you purpose, ended?*
*An achievement that proved your worth, rendered meaningless?*

*If you have, you know what I'm describing. The confusion. The void. The terrifying question: Who am I now?*

*If you haven't yet, I want to prepare you for something:*

*This loss is not the end of your story. It is the end of one story—a story that may have felt like everything but was actually a story that couldn't contain who you're becoming.*

*The loss creates space.*

*The void creates possibility.*

*The death of who you thought you were creates room for who you actually are.*

*I know this is cold comfort when you're in the middle of it. I know the pain is real and the confusion is overwhelming.*

*But I also know that on the other side of this loss, there is something worth finding.*

*Keep walking.*

*Even when you can't see where you're going.*

*The path exists. You just can't see it yet.*
