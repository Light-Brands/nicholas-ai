## The Therapist Named Paul

---

*Actor vs. Director*

---

Paul changed everything.

Not immediately. Not magically. But fundamentally.

He was the first therapist who helped me see the architecture of my brokenness—the actual structure of how I had fractured, the covenants that governed my life, the split between the self I performed and the self I had abandoned.

He gave me a map of my own prison.

And maps are the first step toward escape.

## Meeting Paul

I began working with Paul in 2024, during what I would later call my sabbatical season.

He specialized in Trauma Resurgence Therapy—a method designed to safely access and process deep-rooted trauma stored in the body and nervous system.

Our sessions went deeper than any therapy I had experienced before.

Previous therapists had helped me understand my patterns. Paul helped me see where the patterns came from. Not just the events—the abuse, the heartbreak, the departure from home—but the internal structures that formed in response to those events.

He was the first person who helped me see the covenants.

---

## Actor vs. Director

The framework that transformed my understanding was deceptively simple.

Paul explained that many trauma survivors develop a split between two selves:

**The Actor** is the performing self. The persona created to survive in a world that felt unsafe. The mask developed to protect the wounded core.

For me, the Actor was Nick.

Nick was the character I created when I left home at sixteen. Confident. Charming. Ruthless when necessary. A survivor who would do whatever it took to succeed.

Nick built the nightclub empire. Nick became a millionaire. Nick got sober and became a corporate executive. Nick performed recovery, performed success, performed wellness.

Nick was excellent at his job. The problem was that his job was hiding the truth.

**The Director** is the authentic self. The core identity that existed before trauma. The soul that was wounded and subsequently buried under layers of performance.

For me, the Director was Nicholas.

Nicholas was the eight-year-old who was abused. The fifteen-year-old whose heart was shattered. The child who had spoken prophecy at four and dreamed of touching billions for God.

Nicholas was the one who was wounded. And Nicholas was the one who needed to heal.

But Nicholas had been imprisoned for decades. Nick had taken over the show, and the Director had been banished to a basement where no one could hear him.

## The Split

This framework explained so much.

It explained why I could be sober and still feel sick. The Actor had learned to perform sobriety. But the Director—the wounded core—was unchanged.

It explained why success felt empty. The Actor achieved things. But the Director received nothing from those achievements. The accolades went to a persona, not a person.

It explained why intimacy was impossible. Nancy was trying to connect with Nicholas. But she kept encountering Nick. The Actor didn't know how to be intimate—only how to perform intimacy.

It explained why I kept relapsing despite all my efforts. The Actor could manage the addiction. But when the Actor collapsed—when the career ended and the identity shattered—the unhealed Director had no tools. He only knew one way to cope with pain: substance.

The split was the problem.

And the split had never been addressed.

## The Three Covenants

With Paul's help, I identified the three covenants that had governed my life.

These were not conscious decisions. They were survival mechanisms—unconscious agreements made in moments of overwhelming pain. They operated like software running in the background, directing my behavior without my awareness.

**Covenant 1: Love Equals Suffering**

Made at age fifteen, after my first heartbreak. Reinforced by the earlier abuse that had taught me intimacy leads to violation.

This covenant said: If you let yourself love, you will suffer. Therefore, protect yourself. Keep distance. Never fully surrender to another person.

**Covenant 2: I Will Be My Own God**

Made in the aftermath of the heartbreak and the confusion about why God had allowed my pain.

This covenant said: You cannot trust God. You cannot trust anyone. The only one you can rely on is yourself. Crown yourself sovereign. Need no one.

**Covenant 3: Just Watch Me**

Made at sixteen, standing at the door of my childhood home, looking at my devastated father.

This covenant said: You will prove your worth through undeniable achievement. You will show everyone who doubted you. Success will be your validation.

## Seeing the Roots

Session by session, Paul and I traced how these covenants manifested:

**Depression** was not primarily a chemical imbalance. It was the accumulated weight of suppressed grief, shame, and unprocessed trauma. The Director had decades of unshed tears, unspoken pain, unexpressed truth. The weight of all that suppression manifested as depression.

**Hypomania** was not just bipolar cycling. It was a survival mechanism—the Actor going into overdrive to escape the unbearable pain of stillness. When quiet would mean confronting the wound, the brain created frenetic activity instead.

**Addiction** was not a moral failing or brain disease alone. It was self-medication for unbearable inner anguish. The substances did what they promised—temporarily. They quieted the Director's screaming. They numbed the pain the Actor couldn't fix.

**Insomnia** was not a sleep disorder. It was a nervous system that never learned safety. The abuse had taught my body that danger could come at any moment. The body stayed vigilant, hyperaware, unable to surrender to sleep.

**Anxiety** was not generalized worry. It was the terror of the wounded child who learned the world is dangerous and love is conditional. The nervous system operated as if threat was constant—because for that eight-year-old, it had been.

## Facing the Abuse

With Paul, I began to truly face the sexual abuse for the first time.

Not just acknowledge it—I had acknowledged it before, in previous therapy. But actually face it. Feel it. Grieve it.

For thirty-five years, I had minimized it. Rationalized it. Buried it under layers of achievement and performance.

Now, with Paul's guidance, I began to honor the pain of that little boy.

I let myself feel what he felt. The confusion. The shame. The sense that his body was not his own. The belief that this must be his fault, somehow.

I let myself grieve—not just for what happened, but for all the years lost to that wound. All the relationships damaged. All the joy inaccessible.

The grief was immense. There were sessions where I could barely speak through the tears.

But for the first time, the Director was being seen. The wounded child was being witnessed. The isolation of carrying this alone for thirty-five years was ending.

## Preparing for What Came Next

Paul did something else that would prove crucial:

He prepared me for ibogaine.

He had seen the plant medicine help clients access what years of talk therapy could not. He believed it could accelerate my healing.

But he also cautioned me:

"Ibogaine is not magic. It's a tool. What matters is what you do with what it reveals."

The therapeutic work we were doing was essential preparation. The framework of Actor vs. Director, the identification of the covenants, the beginning of grief work—all of this created a foundation.

I would not go to ibogaine as an escape. I would go with eyes open, heart surrendered, and a map of my own terrain.

Paul was the cartographer. The medicine would be the journey.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you haven't found the right therapist yet, keep looking.*

*Not all therapists are created equal. Not all approaches work for everyone. The modality that helped me might not be what helps you.*

*But the right therapist—the one who helps you see the structure of your wound, who gives you language for what you've been experiencing, who witnesses your pain without trying to rush past it—that person can change everything.*

*Ask yourself:*

*Does my therapist help me see patterns I couldn't see before?*

*Does my therapist create space for the depths of my pain?*

*Does my therapist go beyond managing symptoms to exploring roots?*

*If not, it might be time to seek someone new.*

*The therapeutic relationship is not a luxury. For those of us with deep wounds, it's a necessity.*

*Find your Paul.*
