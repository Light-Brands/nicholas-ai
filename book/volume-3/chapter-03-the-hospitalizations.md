# Chapter Three
## The Hospitalizations

---

*Eighteen Months of Crisis*

---

The first time I was admitted, I thought it would be the last time.

The doctors would stabilize me. Adjust the medications. Send me home healed.

It didn't work that way.

Over the next eighteen months, the hospital became a revolving door. Each admission followed the same arc. Each time, I believed it would be different. Each time, it wasn't.

---

## The Pattern

Every hospitalization followed a predictable pattern:

**Stage One: Relative Stability**

A period of weeks, sometimes months, where the medications seemed to work. Where I could function. Where hope returned.

Nancy and I would start believing we had turned a corner. The children would relax. The household would stabilize.

**Stage Two: The Trigger**

Something would happen. A financial stressor. A conflict. Exhaustion from trying to re-enter the workforce. The anniversary of my termination.

Often, the trigger was minor—nothing that would destabilize a healthy person. But I was not a healthy person. My nervous system was a powder keg, and the smallest spark could ignite it.

**Stage Three: The Descent**

The symptoms would return with ferocity.

Racing thoughts that wouldn't stop. Sleep that disappeared. Mood that swung wildly between despair and grandiose determination.

I would try to manage it. Extra medication. Crisis calls to the psychiatrist. Emergency coping techniques.

Nothing worked.

**Stage Four: The Escalation**

The dysfunction would become impossible to hide.

I couldn't care for myself. Couldn't make decisions. Couldn't be trusted alone.

Nancy would reach her limit—not from lack of love, but from lack of capacity. She couldn't hold the family together while also managing my crisis.

**Stage Five: Admission**

Back to the hospital. The paperwork. The intake. The locked ward with its fluorescent lights and plastic furniture.

Another attempt to stabilize what couldn't seem to stay stable.

---

## The Locked Ward

Let me describe what a psychiatric ward looks like.

Fluorescent lighting that never fully dims. White walls with occasional attempts at cheerfulness—a poster, a painted mural. Plastic furniture bolted to the floor.

Patients in various states of distress. Some pacing. Some catatonic. Some speaking to voices only they could hear.

Nurses behind a station, dispensing medication at scheduled intervals. Doctors appearing for brief consultations, adjusting prescriptions, moving on.

Group therapy sessions where you share your story with strangers who are as broken as you are.

And the sound—always the sound of a locked door. The click of a security mechanism reminding you that you cannot leave until they decide you can.

I was a former VP of Sales. A man who had flown private jets. A man who had built businesses and led teams.

Now I was a patient in a locked ward, waiting for my morning medication, hoping today would be the day they said I could go home.

---

## The Shame

The shame of hospitalization was almost worse than the symptoms.

I was supposed to be better. I had been sober. I had done the work. I had achieved success.

How could I be here?

Each admission felt like proof of my fundamental brokenness. Evidence that I was unfixable. Confirmation of every dark whisper that told me I was a failure.

And there was no hiding it.

The children knew where I was. Extended family knew. Friends from recovery knew.

Nicholas Courchesne, the comeback story, was in the psych ward. Again.

## The Treatments

During these hospitalizations, they tried everything.

**Medication adjustments.** Changing the cocktail. Adding a new mood stabilizer. Increasing the antidepressant. Finding the combination that would finally work.

**Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).** Controlled seizures induced under anesthesia. I underwent multiple sessions. They helped temporarily. The effects didn't last.

**Intensive group therapy.** Hours of processing with other patients. Some insights gained. Nothing that reached the root.

**Discharge planning.** Lists of coping strategies. Crisis hotline numbers. Follow-up appointments scheduled.

Each time, I left believing I was better.

Each time, the pattern repeated.

## The Toll on Nancy

During these eighteen months, Nancy carried a weight that no person should have to carry.

She was mother and father to our children. Perla and Maverick needed her constantly, and I was either absent or incapable.

She was the household manager during financial chaos. With my income gone and medical bills mounting, every dollar required her attention.

She was the crisis handler. The one who recognized when I was spiraling. The one who made the call to the psychiatrist. The one who drove me to the hospital. The one who filled out the paperwork while I sat numbly in the admissions area.

She was the communication hub. Fielding calls from concerned family. Explaining to friends what was happening. Shielding the children from details they were too young to understand.

And she was doing all of this while carrying her own wounds. Her own history of trauma. Her own needs that were being completely neglected.

I would later weep when I finally understood what she endured during these years. The vision of her suffering would become one of the sacred revelations of my transformation.

But in the moment, I was too lost in my own darkness to fully see hers.

---

## The Children

Perla and Maverick were growing up in a household defined by crisis.

They learned early that Daddy had "bad days." That sometimes he had to go away to get better. That things could be okay and then suddenly not okay.

Children adapt. This is both their gift and their tragedy.

They adapted to the instability. They learned to read the signs of a coming episode. They learned to be quiet when Daddy was "resting." They learned to comfort their mother when she was overwhelmed.

They became little adults. Carrying weights that children should never carry.

I had promised to break the cycle. To not pass down my pain.

Instead, I was passing down different pain. Not addiction, but instability. Not abuse, but chaos.

The very thing I most feared was happening, and I was powerless to stop it.

---

## The Medical System

I don't want to condemn the people who treated me during these hospitalizations.

The nurses were often kind. The doctors were generally competent. The system was doing what the system was designed to do: stabilize acute crises and return patients to the community.

But the system was not designed to heal.

It was designed to manage.

Psychiatry, as I experienced it, was focused on symptom reduction. Find the medication cocktail that reduced the symptoms enough for the patient to function. Discharge. Repeat when necessary.

No one asked about the abuse I had experienced at eight years old.

No one explored the covenants I had made in pain.

No one addressed the wound beneath the symptoms.

Because the system wasn't designed for that. The system was designed for throughput. For bed management. For crisis stabilization.

Healing was my responsibility to find elsewhere.

---

## The Cycle Unbroken

Eighteen months. Multiple hospitalizations. Countless medication adjustments.

And the cycle continued.

I would stabilize. I would hope. Something would trigger. I would spiral. I would be hospitalized. I would stabilize. I would hope.

Again and again.

The question that would come to haunt me was forming: *Why can't I heal? I've done everything.*

The answer, I would eventually learn, was that I hadn't done everything. I had done everything the conventional medical system offered. I had done everything the twelve-step program recommended.

But I hadn't faced the wound.

I hadn't broken the covenants.

I hadn't died to the false self that was still running the show.

That work would require something the hospital couldn't provide.

It would require a different kind of medicine entirely.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you have experienced hospitalization—psychiatric or otherwise—I want you to know there is no shame in it.*

*The shame we feel is learned. It comes from a culture that stigmatizes mental illness, that expects us to handle our crises quietly, that judges weakness instead of honoring the courage it takes to seek help.*

*Going to the hospital when you're in crisis is not failure. It is survival.*

*But I also want to be honest: the hospital is not where healing happens.*

*Stabilization happens. Crisis management happens. Medication adjustment happens.*

*Healing—the deep, transformative, root-level healing that changes everything—that requires something more.*

*The hospital can save your life.*

*But you'll need to find what gives your life meaning elsewhere.*

*Keep searching.*

*The answer exists.*
