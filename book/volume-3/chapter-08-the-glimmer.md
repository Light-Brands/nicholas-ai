# Chapter Eight
## The Glimmer

---

*"There Is More. This Is Not the End."*

---

Even in the darkest night, a glimmer persisted.

A small flame that refused to die. A whisper beneath the whispers of death. A knowing—irrational, unjustifiable by any evidence—that something more was coming.

This chapter is about that glimmer. The thing that kept me alive. The preparation for what would come next.

## The Voice That Never Stopped

Throughout everything—the hospitalizations, the relapses, the suicidal ideation, the complete collapse of everything I had built—there was a voice.

Not the voice of death, though that voice was present too.

A different voice. Quieter but more persistent. The same voice I had heard in the snowstorm years before, telling me to stand up and walk toward the light.

It said:

*There is more.*

*This is not the end.*

*There is healing beyond what you've tried.*

I didn't know whose voice it was. My mother's prayers, perhaps, echoing through the spiritual realm. My grandmother's intercession from beyond. The Holy Spirit refusing to release me no matter how far I ran.

All I knew was that something kept whispering possibility when all evidence suggested impossibility.

## The Seeds of Something New

During the therapeutic work with Paul, seeds were planted that would bloom later.

The framework of Actor vs. Director gave me language for my fragmentation. For the first time, I could describe what I had always felt—the split between who I performed and who I was.

The identification of the three covenants illuminated the invisible software running my life. I could now see the code that had been operating in darkness for decades.

The beginning of grief work created cracks in the armor. The tears I shed in therapy were the first honest tears I had cried in years—maybe ever.

These weren't solutions. They were preparations. The soil was being tilled for something that would need deep roots to grow.

## The Whispers of Ibogaine

I began hearing stories.

People who had tried everything—just like me. Who had been hospitalized—like me. Who had relapsed repeatedly—like me. Who had reached the point of utter desperation—like me.

And who had experienced profound transformation through a plant medicine called ibogaine.

At first, I dismissed these stories. They sounded too good to be true. Miraculous claims from a substance I associated with the counterculture, not with legitimate healing.

But the stories persisted. And they came from credible sources—therapists, doctors, people I respected.

I began to research.

Ibogaine was originally derived from the iboga shrub, native to Central Africa. It had been used for centuries in traditional spiritual practices. In the modern era, it had gained attention for its apparent ability to address addiction and trauma at the neurological and psychological level.

The research was limited but promising. The testimonials were overwhelming.

And the desperation I felt—the complete exhaustion of every other option—made me willing to consider something I would have dismissed in any other state.

## The Decision

After much prayer, much research, and many conversations with Nancy and Paul, I made the decision.

I would go to Transcend Clinic in Cancun, Mexico.

I would undergo the ibogaine protocol.

I would face whatever God had to show me.

Nancy was afraid. What if something went wrong? Ibogaine carried medical risks. What if I came back worse instead of better? What if this was just another failed attempt?

Her fears were valid. I shared some of them.

But I also knew, with a certainty I couldn't explain, that this was the path. That God was leading me into something I couldn't understand but had to trust.

I looked into her eyes and said: "I have tried everything else. I believe God is leading me to this. I have to go."

She nodded. She prayed with me. And she released me to the journey.

---

## The Preparation

In the weeks before my departure, I prepared.

Medical tests to ensure my body could handle the treatment. Dietary adjustments. Tapering off certain medications that could interact with the ibogaine.

Mental and spiritual preparation. Journaling. Prayer. Sessions with Paul to ensure I was going with the right mindset.

I wrote letters—to Nancy, to Perla, to Maverick. Just in case. I told them what they meant to me. I apologized for the pain I had caused. I expressed hope for what might come next.

I made peace with my life as it was. If this was the end, I wanted to have said what needed to be said.

And I surrendered the outcome to God.

Whatever happened in that clinic, I was ready.

Ready to live.

Ready to die to the old self.

Ready to be reborn.

## The Glimmer Becomes Light

This volume ends here—at the threshold.

The dark night is not yet over. The transformation has not yet occurred. The covenants have not yet burned before the throne of God.

But the glimmer that sustained me through years of darkness is about to become light.

What happens next—in Volume Four—is the most sacred part of my story. The ibogaine ceremony. The visions. The words "It is finished" spoken as the medicine took hold. The encounter with my father, my children, my abuser. The burning of the covenants before the throne of God. The word repeated over and over as I woke: "Freedom. Freedom. Freedom."

I cannot tell that story here. It deserves its own volume. Its own sacred space.

But I want you to know that the glimmer was true.

*There was more.*

*This was not the end.*

*There was healing beyond what I had tried.*

The dark night was not punishment. It was preparation.

The death of who I thought I was made room for who I actually am.

And the resurrection that follows the dark night is worth every moment of darkness.

## What the Dark Night Taught Me

Before we move to the Reader Integration, let me summarize what the dark night taught:

**Identity built on externals will always collapse.**

Titles, achievements, possessions, status—none of these can be the foundation of who you are. When they're stripped away, whatever was built on them falls too.

**Sobriety is not healing; it's the prerequisite for healing.**

I needed to be sober to do the work. But the work itself was something different entirely.

**The symptoms are not the problem; the wound is the problem.**

Depression, addiction, anxiety, insomnia—these were all pointing to something deeper. Until that depth was addressed, the symptoms would continue.

**The covenants must be seen before they can be broken.**

The unconscious agreements governing my life had to be brought into the light. Only then could they be renounced and replaced.

**The dark night is not optional for some of us.**

I didn't choose the dark night. It came for me. But in retrospect, I needed it. The complete dismantling of who I thought I was made room for who I actually am.

**The glimmer never goes out.**

Even in the deepest darkness, something persists. Something that says *this is not the end.* That something is worth trusting.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you are in the dark night, I cannot promise you when the dawn will come.*

*But I can promise you that it will.*

*The glimmer you feel—however faint, however easily dismissed, however irrational it seems given everything you're experiencing—that glimmer is telling the truth.*

*There is more.*

*This is not the end.*

*There is healing beyond what you've tried.*

*I am living proof.*

*The man who was hospitalized repeatedly, who relapsed after eight years, who heard the whispers of death constantly, who believed he was unfixable—that man found healing.*

*Complete, total, undeniable healing.*

*Not just management. Not just better coping. Transformation.*

*If it happened for me, it can happen for you.*

*Hold on to the glimmer.*

*Follow it where it leads.*

*The dawn is coming.*
