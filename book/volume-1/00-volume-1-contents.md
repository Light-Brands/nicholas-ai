## Volume Theme

**You cannot heal what you refuse to see.**

This volume is an excavation. Before we can build anything that lasts, we must understand what has been built on sand. Before we can come home to the garden of our souls, we must trace the path that led us into the wilderness.

Nicholas's story begins in blessing—a home filled with faith, a grandmother's prayers, miracles as daily reality. But trauma does not wait for an invitation. Between the ages of eight and eleven, his innocence was stolen, and a covenant was formed in the silence of his wounded soul: *Love equals suffering.*

Upon that fractured foundation, he built towers. By twenty-one, he was a millionaire. By twenty-seven, he was drinking himself to death.

This is the story of how a child of miracles became a creature of darkness—and the first step in understanding how he would one day find his way home.

## The Pillar Focus

**Self-Awareness & Honest Diagnosis**

The first pillar of internal transformation requires brutal honesty about what is. Not what we wish were true. Not the story we tell others. Not the persona we've crafted to survive. But the raw, unvarnished truth of our wounds, our patterns, and our self-made prisons.

*"My pursuit is to live every moment in oneness, in intimate union and communion with Jesus Christ in the garden of my heart and soul... bringing the lost travelers back home to Papa."*
