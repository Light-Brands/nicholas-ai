# Chapter Six
## The Woman Who Saw Through

---

*The Sacred Contract*

---

This chapter is about Nancy.

Not as a supporting character in my story, but as the woman whose faith carried us both through decades of darkness. The woman who saw something in me that I couldn't see in myself. The woman who held a vision of my transformation long before I believed transformation was possible.

She deserves her own chapter because, without her, there would be no story to tell.

I would be dead.

## Her Beginning

Nancy's story is not mine to tell in full—that is hers, and perhaps one day she will write it.

But you must understand where she came from to understand what she carried.

Her mother was an alcoholic. Her parents separated when she was young. The home she grew up in was a war zone—not the kind with physical violence, though there was that too, but the kind that slowly poisons everything it touches. Emotional abuse. Neglect. The constant trauma of living with addiction.

At fifteen years old, Nancy left home.

She and her brother had reached the edge of what they could bear. Suicide was a real possibility if they stayed. So they didn't stay.

She worked two jobs. Took responsibility for her brother. Built something from nothing while still a teenager herself.

And through all of this—through poverty and abandonment and the kind of struggle that breaks most people—she had one anchor.

Her grandparents.

They loved her unconditionally. They believed in her when no one else did. They empowered her to see herself as someone who could overcome.

And they introduced her to Jesus.

## The Prayer That Changed Everything

Nancy prayed fiercely in those dark years.

One prayer in particular would echo through both our lives:

*"God, when will I be happy?"*

It was the prayer of someone who had known only struggle. Someone who had never experienced the stability and love that I had taken for granted in my early years. Someone who had earned the right to ask that question.

And God answered.

Not immediately. Not in the way she expected.

He answered by sending her into my chaos.

## The Meeting

When I met Nancy, I was already descending.

The drug dealing, the nightlife, the running from everything good—it was all in full swing. I was a tornado of destruction, leaving wreckage everywhere I touched.

But Nancy saw something the tornado didn't know it contained.

She saw the eye of the storm—the still, silent center where a wounded little boy was hiding.

She saw my heart.

The heart I had convinced myself no longer existed. The heart I had buried so deep that I genuinely believed it was gone. The heart that had been shattered by abuse and heartbreak and sealed behind walls thick enough to stop artillery.

She saw through all of it.

And what she saw, she loved.

---

## The Sacred Contract

There is a kind of love that is more than human.

I didn't understand this for most of my life. I thought love was chemistry—attraction, compatibility, the firing of neurons in response to another person. I reduced it to psychology, to biology, to something that could be explained and therefore controlled.

But what Nancy carried was different.

It was a *calling*.

She told me once—years later, when I could finally hear it—that she knew from the beginning. Knew that we would be married. Knew that she was meant to walk with me through whatever was coming. Knew that her presence in my life was not an accident but an assignment.

This was the sacred contract.

Not a business arrangement. Not a relationship of convenience. Not even the romantic love that songs and movies celebrate.

Something deeper. Something that existed before we were born and will continue after we die.

Nancy was assigned to me. And I to her.

This is not a metaphor. This is what she believed. This is what she held onto through years of my betrayal, my addiction, my cruelty, my absence.

When I asked her once—during the darkest season, when I had given her every reason to leave—why she stayed, she said simply:

*"Because I saw your heart. And I made a promise to God that I would love you into awakening."*

## Life in New York

When I moved permanently to New York, Nancy came with me.

She rented my penthouse in Canada initially—practical arrangements that kept us connected. Then she visited. Fell in love with the city. Found work in the same industry.

We lived together. Best friends, confidants, something that defied easy categorization.

She would do anything for me.

This is not a boast. It is a confession.

I exploited her devotion ruthlessly. I manipulated her. I pushed her past her limits. I used her love as a weapon against her, stepping on her values to satisfy my dark desires.

And she stayed.

Not because she was weak—Nancy is the strongest person I have ever known. But because she was operating on a different set of instructions than I could understand. She was following a calling I had no framework for.

---

## The Prayers That Never Stopped

Every morning, Nancy got on her knees and prayed.

Every night, the same.

She read her Bible in the apartment we shared—the same apartment where the previous night's debauchery still hung in the air. She spoke to a God I had rejected, asking Him to intervene in the life of a man who had crowned himself his own god.

I watched this with something between mockery and awe.

Mockery, because I thought she was deluded. Praying to nothing. Wasting her time with fairy tales while I was out in the "real world" making millions and proving that success didn't require divine assistance.

Awe, because somewhere beneath my cynicism, I recognized what she had.

She had peace.

Not the artificial calm that drugs provided, but something solid. Something that didn't evaporate with the sunrise. Something that remained steady through the chaos I created around her.

She had a connection to something real—and I, despite all my achievements, did not.

Her faithfulness in keeping that connection alive brought a beam of hope into my heart. It was a small beam, almost invisible, fighting against the overwhelming darkness I had cultivated.

But it never went out.

And in the end, it would be part of what led me home.

## What She Endured

I need you to understand what Nancy survived by loving me.

She watched me use drugs until my eyes were hollow. She held me through psychotic episodes that would terrify anyone. She absorbed my rage, my cruelty, my complete inability to receive what she was offering.

She saw me with other women.

Let me say that again, because it deserves to be said clearly: I betrayed her. Repeatedly. Flagrantly. With a carelessness that makes me sick to recall.

And she stayed.

Not because she didn't know—she knew. Not because she accepted it—she confronted me repeatedly. But because she understood something I didn't:

I was not my behavior.

The man doing those terrible things was not the man she loved. She loved the one underneath—the heart she had seen on that first day. And she believed, with a faith that defies reason, that the heart would eventually emerge.

She was right.

It took twenty years. It took her walking through hell with me. It took more pain than anyone should have to endure.

But she was right.

## The Gift of Gucci

In the midst of all this darkness, I wanted to give her something pure.

Nancy had a soul-level love for animals. They had been her survival growing up—the only unconditional love she experienced in that broken home. Dogs, cats, any creature would do—but especially dogs.

For Christmas, I bought her a pug puppy.

We named her Gucci.

That dog became Nancy's constant companion. Her emotional anchor when I was unavailable, which was most of the time. A source of the consistent, reliable love that I was incapable of providing.

Gucci would later become a therapeutic presence through the trials that awaited us. A living reminder that love can be simple, steady, and safe.

Animals understand something that humans often forget: love doesn't require explanation. It just requires presence.

Nancy had been providing that presence for me for years.

I finally gave her a small piece of it in return.

---

## The Question She Asked Herself

I know—because she told me later—that Nancy asked herself a question over and over during those dark years:

*Why am I here?*

Not in an existential sense. In a practical sense.

Why was she staying with a man who treated her so poorly? Why was she pouring her love into a vessel with holes in the bottom? Why was she sacrificing her own wellbeing for someone who wouldn't reciprocate?

The answer she received was always the same:

*Because this is your assignment.*

She didn't stay because I deserved it. I didn't.

She didn't stay because I would change soon. I wouldn't—not for many more years.

She stayed because she believed that love is not transactional. That commitment is not contingent on reciprocity. That sometimes, one person carries the weight until the other person is strong enough to share it.

This is radical love. The kind that makes no sense by worldly standards. The kind that looks foolish, codependent, self-destructive.

But it is also the kind of love that transforms.

## What I See Now

Looking back with the eyes of someone transformed, I can see what I couldn't see then:

Nancy was my lifeline.

The prayers she prayed kept something alive in me. The faith she held carried me when I had no faith of my own. The vision she maintained—of who I could become—was a beacon I would eventually navigate toward.

Without her, I would have drowned.

The addiction would have won. The darkness would have consumed me. The trajectory I was on led only to destruction, and there would have been no force strong enough to alter it.

But Nancy was that force.

Not through nagging. Not through ultimatums. Not through the conventional strategies that partners of addicts are often encouraged to use.

She did it through persistent, unconditional, faith-filled love.

She saw the end from the beginning. She held the vision when I couldn't. She believed in my resurrection when I was still dying.

And when I finally woke up—when I finally came home to myself—she was there. Waiting. Just as she had promised.

## The Sacred Contract Fulfilled

This volume ends before our marriage. Before the years of sobriety and success. Before the collapse that followed and the sacred encounter that healed everything.

But I want you to know where the story is going.

Nancy and I married in 2008. We had children—Perla and Maverick—who became the greatest gifts of our lives. We weathered storms that would have destroyed lesser partnerships.

And when I finally experienced true transformation—when the covenants were burned before the throne of God—one of the things I saw most clearly was Nancy's eye.

God showed me what she had endured. The full weight of her suffering. The cost of her faithfulness.

And for the first time in my life, I wept for her.

Not for myself. For *her*.

I felt what she had felt. I understood what she had sacrificed. I saw the magnitude of the gift she had given me by staying when every reasonable voice would have told her to leave.

That vision—Nancy's eye—is one of the most sacred moments of my entire journey.

Because it showed me what real love looks like.

Not the love I had been taught to fear—the love that equals suffering.

But the love that suffers *for* another. That carries weight so they don't have to carry it alone. That holds a vision so they can eventually see it for themselves.

Nancy loved me into awakening.

And the sacred contract is now complete.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Is there a Nancy in your life?*

*Someone who sees you more clearly than you see yourself? Someone who has stayed when staying made no sense? Someone whose faith in you has outlasted your faith in yourself?*

*If there is, I want you to stop for a moment and really see them.*

*Not as someone who "should" love you because of history or obligation. Not as someone you've taken for granted because they've always been there.*

*But as the gift they are.*

*Real love is rare. Unconditional love is almost nonexistent. To have someone who sees your heart when you've buried it, who believes in your transformation when you've given up—this is not ordinary. This is sacred.*

*If you have such a person, honor them.*

*If you don't, ask yourself: have I made it possible for anyone to love me that way? Have I allowed anyone close enough to see my heart?*

*The walls we build to protect ourselves also keep love out.*

*The covenants we make in pain also block connection.*

*Perhaps it's time to let someone see.*

*Perhaps your Nancy is waiting for you to drop your guard.*

*Perhaps love is closer than you think.*
