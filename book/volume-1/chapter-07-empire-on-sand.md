# Chapter Seven
## Empire on Sand

---

*Ages 22-27*

---

I was going to build something legitimate.

That was the promise I made to myself after the terrorist attacks, after the city died and came back to life, after the money became harder and the risks became clearer.

I was going to exit the shadows and enter the light.

I was going to prove that I could succeed at anything—not just the dark arts of nightlife, but the bright world of business.

*Just watch me.*

## The Aikido Master

I met him in a New York bar.

He was sitting across from me, staring. Not the casual glance of someone people-watching—a fixed, evaluating stare that made me uncomfortable.

I walked over, irritation rising. "Do I know you?"

"No."

"Then why are you staring at me?"

He smiled. "I'm wondering what you're all about."

This was not the response I expected. Something about his presence—calm, centered, completely unafraid despite the hostility I was projecting—made me pause.

We started talking.

At some point, he extended two fingers toward me. "Squeeze as hard as you can."

I grabbed his fingers, intending to hurt him. I was strong—years of training, natural aggression, the physical confidence of a young man in his prime.

He laughed. "You squeeze like a girl."

I was ready to knock him out. He was tall—six-four, two-fifty—but rage doesn't calculate odds.

Then he said: "I'm an eighth-degree black belt in Aikido. Trained in Japan with Steven Seagal."

I released his fingers.

This man would become my sensei, my mentor, and eventually my business partner. He would see the potential I couldn't see in myself and call it forth with the same intensity he used to slap me around on the training mat.

We trained together for two years. I earned my black belt under his guidance. We opened a small Aikido school in New York.

More importantly, he saw past the persona. He told me I needed to make radical decisions about my life. That the path I was on would only grow darker.

He was right about everything except the timing.

I wasn't ready to change. But I was ready to channel my energy somewhere new.

## Extreme Blendz: The Dream of Escape

I discovered a franchise called Extreme Blendz—a healthy juice bar concept operating in gyms across America.

When I looked at it, I didn't see a juice bar. I saw an exit strategy.

Nothing like this existed in Canada. The market was wide open. I could become a franchisor, not just a franchisee. I could build something that would generate income while I slept, that would remove me from the darkness I was starting to tire of.

My business partner and I invested heavily. We secured the Canadian franchise rights. We moved back to Ottawa and opened our first location inside a Florida Fitness gym.

This required a complete transformation—or so I told myself.

New city. New industry. New mindset. No more nightlife. No more cocaine. Just healthy smoothies and protein shakes and the legitimate business world I had always believed I could conquer.

I worked eighty hours a week for the first six months. I was clean. I was focused. I was becoming the entrepreneur I had envisioned at twelve years old.

The exit had worked.

Except it hadn't.

## Egypt Inside Us

We had left Egypt, but Egypt was still living inside us.

This is what the Israelites discovered in the wilderness. You can change your location without changing your soul. You can leave the bondage without leaving the habits that made you suitable for bondage in the first place.

Within months, the old patterns returned.

It started with a drink. Just one, to celebrate a good week. Then another. Then the celebrations happened more frequently. Then the drugs appeared—not as heavily as before, but present. Whispering. Welcoming me back.

I kept promising myself it would be the last time.

It never was.

The harsh reality set in: building juice bars and making them profitable required selling thousands of smoothies per day. Even then, the income was a fraction of what we had made in nightlife.

And unlike nightlife, where the money came fast and the highs were immediate, this was slow. Grinding. The delayed gratification that all legitimate business requires—and that an addict has no tolerance for.

---

## The Collapse

The gym where we had opened our flagship location went bankrupt.

Overnight, our foot traffic dropped by sixty percent. The members who had made up our customer base weren't coming to work out—they were canceling their memberships.

Simultaneously, a competitor called Booster Juice launched in Canada. They bought supplies from local manufacturers at a reasonable exchange rate. We were importing from the United States at one of the worst exchange rates in twenty years.

And then my business partner betrayed me.

He went behind my back and began opening franchises through a different corporation, cutting me out of deals I had originated.

I was forced to buy him out with money I didn't have.

The betrayal activated every wound I carried. The abandonment from the abuse. The rejection from the heartbreak. The covenants that whispered: *see? You can't trust anyone. Everyone leaves. Everyone betrays.*

I cried out to God—the God I had rejected—asking for help. Using Him as a spare tire, the way I always did when the road got rough.

And somehow, miraculously, I sold the business for seventy cents on the dollar. A loss, but not a catastrophe.

I took it as a sign that I was destined for something bigger.

I was wrong. It was a lifeboat, not a launching pad.

## Toronto: The Fresh Start

We moved to Toronto. Again.

New city. Fresh start. The same language of self-deception I had been speaking for years.

We rented a mansion in Woodbridge. I drove a brand-new Cadillac Escalade EXT. The money from the franchise sale gave us a runway, a chance to build something before the funds ran dry.

I committed to change. Really change this time. No more nightlife. No more drugs. Serious martial arts training. Personal development. All the right words, all the right intentions.

And for a while, it worked.

I trained at one of the top Muay Thai gyms in the city. Made genuine friendships. Felt, for the first time in years, like part of a healthy community.

I applied personal development concepts I had learned from mentors. They worked. The depression lifted. The compulsions quieted. I felt a happiness I hadn't experienced in what felt like forever.

Maybe this time was different.

Maybe I had finally escaped the cycle.

## Zugari: The Return of the Idol

Then the phone rang.

An old friend with a business concept. A high-end women's swimwear brand called Zugari. Fashion shows. Beautiful models. Luxury lifestyles. Parties on yachts.

As he described the vision, something inside me ignited.

Not the healthy fire of genuine ambition. The old fire. The idolatry of glamour. The worship of surfaces. The addiction to everything that glitters.

I shook his hand. "I'm in."

What happened to my good intentions? What happened to my desire to change?

I convinced myself this time would be different. That I had matured. That I could be around the old temptations without being consumed by them.

The lie we tell ourselves when we want what we want.

## M1 Boxing Academy

At the same time, I channeled my passion for discipline into building M1 Boxing Academy—a Thai boxing and MMA gym with cutting-edge strength and conditioning facilities.

This was meant to be the healthy side of my life. The warrior path. The place where I could express the fighter in me without the darkness of the nightclub.

For a while, it was exactly that. We trained hard. We built something real. We helped people transform their bodies and their confidence.

But the darkness was circling.

One weekend, I traveled to Montreal for a Muay Thai tournament. My opponent never showed. Something in me snapped.

I drank myself nearly to death that night. Got into a violent altercation with a teammate. Blacked out completely—the first time I had ever lost hours of memory to alcohol.

The next morning, I remembered nothing.

The owner and coach confronted me. Told me my behavior would not be tolerated. Said I was no longer welcome at the gym.

What was my response? The only response I knew:

*"Just watch me."*

I gathered a group of former teammates. We opened our own gym. A few blocks away. Direct competition.

The covenant was running the show. Always proving. Always defying. Always building towers to prove that I could.

## The Towers Rise

By 2006, I had my fingers in everything.

**Zugari** immersed me in the world of fashion—photo shoots, runway shows, the beautiful people doing beautiful things. The perfect mask for a man dying inside.

**M1 Boxing Academy** was my tribute to discipline and dominance. Warriors training warriors. A place where pain was respected and weakness was forged into strength.

Real estate investments continued to grow. Properties acquired, equity built, the financial foundation of the king I was pretending to be.

From the outside, I was thriving.

Multiple businesses.
Luxury lifestyle.
Beautiful women.
Fast cars.
VIP everything.

The twelve-year-old who had declared he would be a billionaire was well on his way.

But that twelve-year-old hadn't understood something essential:

**You can build towers to heaven, but if the foundation is sand, they will all fall.**

---

## The Fractures Widen

Behind the facade, everything was cracking.

The drugs had returned in full force. Cocaine was my constant companion again—the friend who made every party better, every insecurity vanish, every hard conversation avoidable.

The alcohol was escalating. What had been heavy social drinking was becoming something else. Something I needed to function. Something I couldn't stop.

My relationships were chaos. I was cheating on Nancy regularly, treating women as disposable, proving over and over that the covenant—*love equals suffering*—was true.

And the blackouts were becoming more frequent. Lost hours. Lost nights. Waking up covered in shame without knowing what I had done.

The little boy inside me—the one the abuse had fractured—was screaming louder than ever. And I was using every substance available to drown him out.

---

## What I See Now

Looking back, I can see what I couldn't see then:

Every business I built was an extension of my covenants.

Zugari was *just watch me*—proving my taste, my sophistication, my ability to move in elite circles.

M1 Boxing was *just watch me*—proving my strength, my discipline, my dominance over weaker men.

The real estate was *just watch me*—proving my financial acumen, my building of wealth, my escape from the poverty I feared.

None of it was building toward anything real. None of it was creating a life that could sustain. All of it was performance—a desperate attempt to convince myself and the world that I was someone worth respecting.

But you cannot build sustainable success on unsustainable foundations.

The towers were impressive. The sand beneath them was shifting.

And the collapse was coming.

## The Warning Signs

My mother called me regularly. The same warning, every time:

"Nicholas, you cannot continue living this destructive lifestyle. You're going to hit a wall. Somehow, somewhere—you're going to crash."

She was praying for me. She never stopped. The same woman who had sacrificed her career to raise me in God's ways, who had pressed Scripture into my heart at bedtime, who had never stopped believing in the calling she had heard before I was born.

She would remind me of Proverbs 22:6: *"Train up a child in the way he should go, and even when he is old, he will not depart from it."*

She believed—she knew—that God would bring me back.

"You're doomed," she would say, but not as a curse. As a declaration. "You have a praying mother, a praying grandmother in heaven, and many others interceding for your life. The prayers will catch up with you."

I heard her warnings.

I ignored them.

I was too busy building my empire to notice the sand shifting beneath it.

*Dear Traveler,*

*What are you building?*

*Not the surface answer—not your job title or your bank balance or your social media presence.*

*What are you really building? And what foundation are you building it on?*

*If your building is an extension of covenants made in pain—if it exists to prove your worth, to show the doubters, to escape the wounds you refuse to face—then I have difficult news:*

*It will not stand.*

*Not because you're not talented enough. Not because you haven't worked hard enough. Not because the market won't support it.*

*Because sand cannot hold towers.*

*The good news is that you don't have to tear everything down. You don't have to abandon your ambition or your dreams.*

*But you do have to examine the foundation.*

*You do have to ask yourself: Am I building this from wholeness or from wound? Am I creating something that serves life, or constructing a monument to my own pain?*

*The towers I built all fell.*

*But the ones I built after transformation—after the covenants were burned, after the wound was healed, after the foundation was changed—those still stand.*

*The dream of blessing millions was never wrong.*

*The foundation was.*
