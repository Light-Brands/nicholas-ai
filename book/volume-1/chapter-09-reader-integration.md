## Exercises and Reflections for Volume I

---

> *"You cannot heal what you refuse to see."*

---

You have just walked through the fractured foundation of one man's life.

From blessing to abuse. From love to heartbreak. From faith to rebellion. From empire to ashes.

This chapter is where the story becomes yours.

The exercises that follow are not homework. They are not tests. They are invitations—doorways into the parts of yourself that may have been hidden, buried, or protected for years.

Move at your own pace. Skip what doesn't resonate. Return to what does. And remember: transformation is not an event. It's a journey.

## Section One: Identifying Hidden Wounds

Nicholas's story reveals that our deepest wounds often remain invisible—even to ourselves. They hide beneath success, beneath coping mechanisms, beneath the stories we tell about who we are.

### Exercise 1.1: The Timeline of Wounds

Take a piece of paper and draw a horizontal line across the center. This represents your life from birth to the present day.

Mark the following on your timeline:
- Your birth
- The present day
- Major life transitions (moves, school changes, marriages, divorces, career shifts)

Now, slowly and carefully, mark any moment that left a wound. These might include:
- Experiences of violation or abuse
- Significant losses (death, divorce, abandonment)
- Betrayals or broken trust
- Moments of shame or humiliation
- Experiences that made you feel unsafe

For each wound, note (if you can) what age you were.

**Reflection questions:**
- Which wounds have I never fully acknowledged?
- Which wounds still influence my behavior today?
- Which wounds am I still running from?

---

### Exercise 1.2: The Buried Child

Nicholas carried a wounded eight-year-old inside him for thirty-five years. Many of us carry younger versions of ourselves who were never properly seen or healed.

Close your eyes. Take several deep breaths.

Imagine walking through a house—any house that comes to mind. As you walk through the rooms, you eventually find a door to a basement. You open the door and descend the stairs.

In the basement, there is a child. This is a younger version of you—from whatever age emerges.

**Notice:**
- How old are they?
- What are they wearing?
- What is their posture?
- What expression is on their face?
- What do they seem to need?

**Journaling prompt:**
Write a letter to this child. Tell them:
- What you now understand about what they went through
- That what happened was not their fault
- What you wish someone had said to them at the time
- That you see them now

---

## Section Two: Identifying Unconscious Covenants

Nicholas identified three covenants that governed his life:
1. "Love equals suffering"
2. "I am my own god"
3. "Just watch me"

These were not conscious decisions. They were survival mechanisms formed in moments of pain—invisible agreements that became the operating system of his soul.

### Exercise 2.1: The Covenant Inventory

Complete the following sentences as quickly as possible, without overthinking:

**About Love:**
- Love always leads to _________________.
- If I let someone get too close, they will _________________.
- The safest approach to relationships is _________________.

**About Trust:**
- I can only really trust _________________.
- People will always _________________.
- The last time I fully trusted someone, _________________.

**About Worth:**
- I am only valuable when I _________________.
- If I don't _________________, people will _________________.
- My worth depends on _________________.

**About Power:**
- The only person I can count on is _________________.
- Needing help is _________________.
- Being in control is important because _________________.

**Review your answers.** Look for patterns. What invisible beliefs are operating beneath your conscious awareness?

---

### Exercise 2.2: The Origin Stories

For each belief you identified above, ask yourself:

- When did I first believe this?
- What happened that made this seem true?
- Who taught me this (intentionally or unintentionally)?
- What was I protecting myself from by adopting this belief?

The goal is not to judge these beliefs, but to understand them. They served a purpose. They helped you survive.

The question is: Do they still serve you today?

---

### Exercise 2.3: The Three Covenants

Based on your work above, try to articulate your own three core covenants. These are the deepest, most fundamental beliefs that shape your behavior.

**My Covenant #1:**
_____________________________________________

*Formed when:* _______________________________
*The protection it provided:* ___________________
*The price I pay for it today:* __________________

**My Covenant #2:**
_____________________________________________

*Formed when:* _______________________________
*The protection it provided:* ___________________
*The price I pay for it today:* __________________

**My Covenant #3:**
_____________________________________________

*Formed when:* _______________________________
*The protection it provided:* ___________________
*The price I pay for it today:* __________________

## Section Three: The Masks We Wear

Nicholas developed the persona of "Hollywood Nick"—the confident, successful, untouchable entrepreneur. This mask protected the wounded child underneath but eventually became a prison.

### Exercise 3.1: The Mask Inventory

List the different "versions" of yourself that you present in different contexts:

**At work, I am:**
(How do you present yourself? What parts of yourself do you hide?)

**With family, I am:**
(How do you present yourself? What parts of yourself do you hide?)

**With friends, I am:**
(How do you present yourself? What parts of yourself do you hide?)

**On social media, I am:**
(How do you present yourself? What parts of yourself do you hide?)

**When alone, I am:**
(Who are you when no one is watching?)

**Reflection questions:**
- How different are these versions of you?
- Which mask is the most exhausting to wear?
- What would happen if you stopped wearing it?
- What are you afraid people would see if the mask came off?

---

### Exercise 3.2: The Actor vs. The Director

Nicholas's therapist introduced him to the concept of the Actor and the Director—the performed self versus the authentic self that observes the performance.

**The Actor** is the part of you that:
- Says what you think people want to hear
- Performs the version of yourself that gets approval
- Reacts automatically from old patterns
- Is driven by the need to survive, succeed, or be accepted

**The Director** is the part of you that:
- Can observe your own performance with some distance
- Knows when you're being authentic and when you're not
- Has a sense of who you really are, beneath the performance
- Can choose different responses rather than just reacting

**Journaling prompt:**
Think of a recent situation where you were clearly in "Actor" mode—performing rather than being authentic.

- What triggered the performance?
- What was the Actor trying to achieve or protect?
- What would the Director have done differently?
- What prevented you from listening to the Director?

## Section Four: The Towers on Sand

Nicholas built impressive enterprises on a fractured foundation. The towers looked magnificent but were always sinking.

### Exercise 4.1: Examining Your Towers

List the major "towers" you have built in your life. These might include:
- Career achievements
- Relationships
- Financial accomplishments
- Public image or reputation
- Physical appearance or fitness
- Social status or influence

For each tower, ask yourself:

**This tower exists because I needed to prove:**
_____________________________________________

**The foundation of this tower is:**
- [ ] Wholeness and genuine desire
- [ ] Wound and the need to prove something
- [ ] Mixed (some of both)

**If this tower collapsed, I would feel:**
_____________________________________________

**What this tower tells me about my core wounds:**
_____________________________________________

---

### Exercise 4.2: The "Just Watch Me" Audit

Nicholas's "Just Watch Me" covenant drove him to build empires to prove his doubters wrong.

**Journaling prompts:**

- Who are you still trying to prove something to?
- What would you stop doing if you had nothing left to prove?
- How much of your striving is driven by genuine desire versus the need for validation?
- If everyone who ever doubted you suddenly approved of you, what would change about your life?

---

## Section Five: The Breaking Point

Sometimes things have to break before they can be rebuilt. The breaking point is not the end—it's a threshold.

### Exercise 5.1: Your Breaking Points

Reflect on any "breaking points" you have experienced—moments when everything seemed to collapse.

For each one, consider:

- What broke?
- What was the immediate aftermath?
- What, if anything, emerged from the breaking?
- How did the breaking point change you?

**Journaling prompt:**
If you haven't yet experienced a major breaking point, consider:
- What towers are you holding onto that might need to fall?
- What would have to happen for you to stop running?
- What are you most afraid of losing?

---

### Exercise 5.2: Letter from the Future Self

Imagine yourself five years from now—but in a version of the future where real transformation has occurred. Not perfection, but genuine change. The wounds have been faced. The covenants have been broken. The masks have come off.

From that future self, write a letter to your present self.

**Include:**
- What you want your present self to know about the journey ahead
- What needed to change for transformation to occur
- What you had to let go of
- What you discovered about yourself
- What remains constant even after transformation

---

## Section Six: Finding Your Nancy

Nancy held a vision for Nicholas when he couldn't hold one for himself. Her faith carried them both through decades of darkness.

### Exercise 6.1: Your Support Inventory

List the people in your life who might serve as "Nancys"—those who:
- See you more clearly than you see yourself
- Hold hope for you when you've lost hope
- Love you even when you're unlovable
- Tell you the truth even when it's uncomfortable

For each person, consider:
- Have you let them truly see you?
- Have you told them what you're really struggling with?
- What stops you from being fully honest with them?

---

### Exercise 6.2: The Invitation

Transformation is rarely a solo journey. We need witnesses. We need people who can hold space for our breaking and our rebuilding.

**Action step:**
Choose one person from your list above. Schedule a conversation with them. Share something—just one thing—that you've been hiding behind a mask.

The goal is not to unload everything. The goal is to practice vulnerability. To take one small step toward letting someone see the real you.

---

## Final Reflection

You have walked through the fractured foundation.

You have examined wounds, covenants, masks, and towers.

You have asked difficult questions of yourself.

This is courageous work. This is the beginning of transformation.

**As you close this volume, ask yourself:**

1. What is the one insight that resonated most deeply?

2. What is the one thing you now see that you couldn't see before?

3. What is the one action—however small—that you will take as a result of this reading?

Write these down. Share them with someone you trust.

The journey home has begun.
