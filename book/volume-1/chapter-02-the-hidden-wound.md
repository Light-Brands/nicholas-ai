# Chapter Two
## The Hidden Wound

---

*Ages 8-11*

---

I need to tell you something that I could not speak for thirty-five years.

Something that shaped every relationship I would ever have. Every business decision. Every drink I poured down my throat. Every night I prayed for death. Every mask I wore. Every empire I built.

This is the wound beneath all other wounds. The first fracture. The genesis of the split that would cleave my soul in two.

Between the ages of eight and eleven, I was sexually abused.

---

## The Sanctuary That Wasn't

To understand how this happened, you must understand where I was raised.

Our church was a closed-brethren Christian assembly. We were separate from the world—and we took this separation seriously. No television. No radio. No movies. Limited access to culture beyond our walls. We were overprotected by design, insulated from the corruption of secular society.

Or so we believed.

What I learned was fear. Not the reverent awe of a child encountering the sacred—but the trembling terror of a boy who understood that God was watching, always watching, ready to punish every transgression. I learned rules instead of relationship. Doctrine instead of connection. Fear instead of grace.

Church was our entire life. The members were our extended family. The building was our second home. If there was anywhere on earth I should have been safe, it was there.

But sanctuary became slaughter.

---

## The Predator in Plain Sight

He was older. Part of our community. Someone my parents trusted. Someone I was told to trust.

I cannot write his full name here. Not because I haven't forgiven—I have, in a ceremony before the throne of God that you will read about later in this series. But because his name is not the point. His name represents a category of evil that exists in every community, every church, every organization where children gather.

He saw something in me. Vulnerability, perhaps. Innocence. A child who wanted to belong, who was taught to obey authority, who had not yet learned that adults could be predators.

The abuse didn't begin with violence. It began with grooming. Attention. Special treatment. The slow erosion of boundaries until what was unthinkable became routine.

For three years.

Three years of violation that I could not name. Three years of confusion and shame and terror that had no language. Three years of a child learning that the most intimate parts of his body and soul were not his own.

---

## The Silence

I told no one.

How could I? I didn't have words for what was happening. I didn't understand it. And somewhere in my child's mind, I knew that speaking would shatter everything. My family. My church. My sense of safety in a world that suddenly had none.

So I buried it.

I pushed it down so deep that I convinced myself it hadn't happened. The mind has extraordinary mechanisms for protecting itself from truths too devastating to hold. I developed what psychologists would later call dissociation—the ability to separate from my own experience, to watch myself from a distance, to become an actor in my own life rather than the one truly living it.

This was the beginning of the split.

There was the Nicholas who smiled in church and recited Bible verses and preached to his family with a whiteboard. And there was another Nicholas—a terrified, frozen child trapped in a basement of shame, screaming in silence where no one could hear.

I would not excavate this wound for thirty-five years. It would govern my life from the shadows, invisible but omnipresent. Every self-destructive choice I made, every relationship I sabotaged, every time I reached for a bottle or a line of cocaine to numb a pain I couldn't name—this wound was the source.

You cannot heal what you refuse to see.

And I refused to see this for most of my life.

---

## The First Covenant

In the silence of my wounded soul, something formed. Not a conscious decision—I was too young for that. But a *covenant*. An invisible agreement that would operate like software in my subconscious, directing my choices and my feelings for decades to come.

The covenant was this: **Love equals suffering.**

Think about what that means.

If love equals suffering, then to be loved is to be hurt. To be intimate is to be violated. To trust is to be betrayed.

And the inverse becomes equally true: if I am suffering, it must mean I am loved. If I am being hurt, it must mean I am in relationship.

This covenant explained why I would spend the next thirty years choosing partners who wounded me. Why I would sabotage every healthy relationship that threatened to prove love could be safe. Why I would flee at the first sign of genuine intimacy.

I wasn't making bad choices. I was *faithful* to a vow I never consciously made. I was *honoring* an agreement I didn't know existed.

The abuse created the wound. But the covenant kept it bleeding.

## What Abuse Does to a Soul

I want you to understand something that took me decades to learn:

Sexual abuse doesn't just damage the body. It fractures the soul.

When someone violates you in this way—especially as a child, especially by someone who should protect you—they are not just committing a physical act. They are rewriting your internal reality. They are teaching you that:

- Your boundaries don't matter
- Your "no" is meaningless
- Your body belongs to others
- Secrecy and shame are the price of love
- You are not worth protecting

These lessons embed themselves at the deepest level of identity. They don't require conscious memory to operate. They run in the background, shaping every interaction, every decision, every moment of intimacy or vulnerability.

I walked away from those three years with no visible scars. I functioned. I succeeded. I built businesses and made millions and performed excellence at the highest levels.

But underneath it all, I was a fractured child pretending to be a powerful man.

---

## The Double Life Begins

After the abuse ended, something in me shifted. The boy who had preached with such confidence, who had spoken prophecy at four years old, who had dreamed of touching billions—that boy retreated.

In his place emerged someone harder. Someone who watched the world with suspicious eyes. Someone who had learned that trust was dangerous and vulnerability was weakness.

I still went to church. Still recited the verses. Still played the role of the faithful Christian child.

But the connection was severed. How could I trust a God who had allowed this to happen? How could I believe in protection when I had been so profoundly unprotected? How could I accept love when love had become synonymous with pain?

The spiritual sensitivity that had once been my gift became my torment. I could still feel the presence of the Divine—but now I fled from it. I could still hear that still, small voice—but now I drowned it out with noise and activity and eventually with substances that could silence anything.

I was eight years old when the abuse began.

By fifteen, I would turn my back on God entirely.

By sixteen, I would leave home with a vow on my lips: *Just watch me.*

By twenty-one, I would be a millionaire—and completely empty inside.

By twenty-seven, I would be drinking forty to sixty ounces of liquor daily, hoping to die.

All of this flowed from a wound I could not see, operating through a covenant I could not name.

## The Hidden Cost

Let me be clear about something: I am not presenting my abuse as an excuse for the choices I made.

I am presenting it as an *explanation*.

There is a vast difference.

Millions of people are abused and do not become drug dealers. Millions are violated and do not spend decades destroying themselves. The wound explains the vulnerability—it does not erase the responsibility.

But here is what I now understand:

When you carry an unhealed wound, you will either heal it or pass it on. You will either face it or reenact it. You will either grieve it or medicate it.

I chose to medicate. For decades. With alcohol, with cocaine, with sex, with success, with adrenaline, with anything that could temporarily silence the screaming child in the basement of my soul.

And the wound only grew.

## The Fracture Deepens

By the time the abuse ended, I was no longer one person. I had split into fragments:

**The Performer**: The one who knew how to smile, how to charm, how to say what people wanted to hear. This fragment would one day build businesses and seduce crowds and wear designer suits while dying inside.

**The Protector**: The one who built walls. Who trusted no one fully. Who learned that keeping people at a distance was the only way to stay safe. This fragment would destroy every intimate relationship it touched.

**The Wounded Child**: The one who never grew up. Who stayed frozen at eight years old, curled in shame and terror, waiting for someone to finally see him and say *I'm sorry. It wasn't your fault. You are still worthy of love.* This fragment would wait thirty-five years to be seen.

This internal fragmentation—this splitting of the self into parts that couldn't communicate with each other—became the architecture of my life.

I didn't know it had a name. I didn't know therapists would later call it dissociation, or that the covenants forming in my subconscious were textbook trauma responses.

I just knew that something was fundamentally broken. And I couldn't tell anyone. And I didn't know how to fix it.

So I learned to perform.

## A Prayer in the Darkness

Even now, after all the healing I've experienced, I cannot fully access those years. The memories are fragmentary—flashes of sensation, spikes of emotion, a pervasive sense of dread that has no specific content.

My mind protected me by burying what I couldn't survive knowing.

But I carry this truth in my body. In the way I flinch at certain touches. In the nightmares that still occasionally surface. In the vigilance that never fully rests.

And I carry something else: a fierce determination that no child should ever suffer in silence the way I suffered.

If you are reading this and you carry a similar wound—if the words on this page are awakening memories you've tried to bury—I want you to know something:

It was not your fault.

Whatever happened to you, whoever did it, however long you've kept silent: it was not your fault.

You were a child. You deserved protection. You deserved safety. You deserved love without violation.

And if you didn't receive those things—if the adults in your life failed you—that failure was theirs, not yours.

The shame you carry is not your shame. It was placed on you by someone who should have carried their own.

You can put it down now.

You can put it down.

## The Foundation Is Fractured

This is the wound beneath my story.

Every chapter that follows—the teenage rebellion, the departure from home, the nightlife empire, the millions made and the soul bankrupted, the alcoholism, the psychosis, the multiple rehabs, the years of sobriety that still couldn't touch the core wound—all of it flows from this fractured foundation.

I built towers on sand. Magnificent, gleaming towers that everyone admired. But the sand was my unhealed trauma, and no matter how high I built, the foundation was sinking.

You cannot heal what you refuse to see.

For thirty-five years, I refused to see this wound. I ran from it. I medicated it. I buried it under success and substances and constant motion.

Until I couldn't run anymore.

Until the towers fell.

Until I finally faced the eight-year-old boy I had abandoned in that basement of shame.

And when I finally saw him—when I finally held him—I discovered something that changed everything:

He had been waiting for me all along.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If this chapter has stirred something in you—if you carry wounds from childhood that you have never spoken aloud—I want you to know that you are not alone.*

*Millions of us walk through life with hidden fractures, smiling on the outside while bleeding within. We perform wellness. We achieve success. We convince the world that we are fine while something in us screams that we are not.*

*This is the first step of healing: acknowledgment. Not necessarily to another person—not yet, if you're not ready. But to yourself. In the privacy of your own heart, allow yourself to whisper: Something happened to me. And it was not my fault.*

*You do not have to excavate everything today. You do not have to face the full weight of your wound in this moment. But you can crack the door. You can let a sliver of light into that basement.*

*The child who was wounded is still there, waiting for you to return.*

*And when you're ready—when you've gathered the strength and the support you need—you can go back for them.*

*They've been waiting so long.*

*Don't make them wait forever.*
