# Chapter Eight
## The Breaking Point

---

*May 2007*

---

My mother said I would hit a wall.

She said I was doomed—doomed by the prayers that pursued me, by the God who refused to let me go, by the calling that I could run from but never escape.

In May of 2007, I hit that wall at full speed.

And everything I had built came crashing down.

---

## The Night Before

Nancy was in New York.

She had gone back to work in nightlife—a pattern we had established, where she would support us financially while I built the businesses that never quite succeeded the way I promised they would. It was a sacrifice I demanded from her, another way I exploited her devotion.

I was alone in Toronto. The gym was struggling. Zugari was hemorrhaging money. The facade was cracking, and I could feel it—a pressure building in my chest that no amount of cocaine could relieve.

I went out.

Not to any particular club. Just out. Into the night that had always welcomed me. Into the darkness that felt more like home than any home I had ever known.

The drugs were plentiful. The alcohol was bottomless. The hours blurred into each other the way they always did when I was trying to escape.

I don't remember most of it.

What I remember is waking up.

---

## The Break

The next morning, something happened that I still struggle to articulate.

The persona I had built since I was sixteen years old—the mask I had constructed through years of performance, the identity I had fed with money and sex and substances and success—it turned on me.

The monster I had created decided it was done being controlled.

It wanted to destroy its creator.

I felt it happen. A fracturing of consciousness. A splitting that was no longer manageable, no longer something I could compartmentalize and hide.

The fragments of myself that I had kept separate—the performer, the protector, the wounded child—they all collapsed into each other like buildings falling into their own footprints.

And in the rubble, something emerged that I can only call demonic.

---

## The Possession

I do not use this word lightly.

I am not speaking metaphorically or dramatically. I am describing what I experienced—the absolute, visceral sense that something had taken control. Something that was not me. Something that wanted me dead.

The voices started.

Not auditory hallucinations in the clinical sense. Something worse. A constant, screaming chorus inside my skull that never stopped, never quieted, never gave me a moment's peace.

*You deserve this.*

*This is who you really are.*

*There is no escape.*

*Die. Die. Die.*

I saw things. Shadows that moved when they shouldn't move. Faces in the corners of rooms. Presences that I could feel more than see—malevolent, patient, waiting.

I didn't sleep. Couldn't sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, the visions intensified. So I stayed awake, for days, while my mind deteriorated further.

This was psychosis. I know that now. The result of years of substance abuse, sleep deprivation, and unprocessed trauma finally colliding.

But in the moment, I didn't have a clinical framework. I only had experience.

And the experience was hell.

---

## The Self-Medication

There was only one thing that quieted the screaming.

Alcohol.

Not the social drinking of the party scene. Not the casual glass of wine with dinner.

Forty to sixty ounces of hard liquor. Every day.

That's nearly two liters of spirits, daily, for those keeping track. A quantity that should have killed me. A quantity that I needed just to function—to stop my hands from shaking, to quiet the voices to a manageable roar, to exist in my own skin for a few hours.

I was drinking to survive.

And I was drinking to die.

The two impulses lived side by side. I needed the alcohol to keep going. And I hoped, every night, that I would drink enough to never wake up.

This was not suicidal ideation in the active sense. I wasn't planning anything. I wasn't researching methods. I simply didn't want to exist anymore. And every drink was a coin flip—maybe this one would be the one that ended it.

The spirit of death whispered in my ear constantly now. Its voice was the clearest of all the voices.

*You deserve this.*

*Your family would be better off without you.*

*There is nothing left to live for.*

*Just let go.*

---

## The Void

I was empty.

Not in the way I had been empty before—that chronic, low-grade dissatisfaction that accompanies even the most successful lives built on sand.

This was absolute emptiness. A void. The complete absence of anything that resembled hope, purpose, or meaning.

I had achieved everything the world told me to achieve. I had the money, the businesses, the lifestyle, the women, the status, the power. I had proven what I set out to prove at sixteen years old.

*Just watch me.*

They were watching. And there was nothing to see.

The covenant had been fulfilled. I had succeeded. And the success was ash in my mouth.

If this was winning, then winning was worthless. If this was the summit, then the summit was a trap. If this was everything I had worked for—the validation of all my striving—then the striving itself had been a lie.

The emptiness was not the absence of achievement. It was the *presence* of achievement revealing that achievement was never the point.

## Shame and Guilt

The morning light was the worst.

At night, in the darkness, there was anonymity. The drinking and the drugs and the parties all blurred together. The persona could still function, still perform, still convince whoever was watching that everything was fine.

But in the morning, when the substances wore off enough for clarity to return, I had to face myself.

And I hated what I saw.

The shame was physical. I could feel it in my body—a weight pressing on my chest, a nausea that had nothing to do with hangover. The accumulated guilt of every terrible choice, every betrayal, every wound I had inflicted on others and on myself.

I thought of my parents, who had raised me with such love, watching their son destroy himself.

I thought of Nancy, who had given me everything and received only pain in return.

I thought of the little boy who had spoken prophecy at four years old, who had dreamed of touching billions for the Kingdom, who had been so full of light before the darkness came.

What had I done to him? What had I become?

The shame fed the drinking. The drinking fed the shame. The cycle was unbreakable, self-perpetuating, a wheel that only turned in one direction.

## The Daily Ritual

My days had no structure except the structure of survival.

Wake up shaking. Hands trembling so violently I couldn't hold a glass.

First drink of the day—whiskey, vodka, whatever was closest—just to stop the shaking. Just to quiet the screaming inside my skull. Just to make it possible to stand.

Then more. And more. Until the tremors stopped and the world took on that amber glow that meant I could function.

Some days I managed to go through the motions. Show up at the gym. Pretend to work on the business. Convince whoever was watching that I was still in control.

Most days I didn't.

Most days I sat in my apartment, drinking, waiting for the night when I could go out and do it all over again. Waiting for the next morning when I would pray for death and be disappointed by life.

The money was draining. The businesses were failing. The empire was collapsing in real-time.

And I couldn't stop.

## The Voice That Remained

Even in the depths of this hell, there was a voice that was different from the others.

Not the demons—they were constant, a choir of accusation and invitation to death.

But something else. Something quieter. Something that sounded like the child who used to preach with a whiteboard.

*This is not the end.*

*There is more.*

*You were made for something else.*

I hated this voice most of all. The demons I could understand—they made sense of my situation, validated my self-destruction, offered an ending to the pain.

But this voice offered hope. And hope, in that state, was the cruelest torture of all. Hope meant I might have to keep living. Hope meant the pain might continue. Hope meant I couldn't just surrender to the darkness and be done.

I tried to drown it out with the other voices, with the alcohol, with the cocaine.

It refused to die.

The prayers of my mother. The faith of my grandmother. The covenant Nancy had made with God about loving me into awakening.

They were all still operating. Still pushing back against the darkness. Still keeping a thread of light alive in the abyss.

---

## The Bottom

They say you have to hit bottom before you can start climbing up.

But what they don't tell you is that bottom is different for everyone. Some people hit it quickly—a single moment of clarity, a dramatic intervention, a near-death experience that shocks them awake.

For others, the bottom is a basement with a floor that keeps dropping. Every time you think you've reached it, it gives way beneath you and you fall further.

May 2007 was my first bottom.

I wouldn't recognize it as such for months. I would continue drinking, continue destroying, continue the slow-motion suicide I had chosen over living.

But something shifted in that month. The persona's total victory over my authentic self had also been its defeat. In becoming everything, it had revealed itself as nothing.

The towers had fallen. Not just the businesses—those were still technically operating—but the internal towers. The structures of meaning I had built to justify my choices.

*Just watch me.*

I had nothing left to show.

## The End of Volume One

This is where this volume ends.

Not with triumph. Not with transformation. Not with the resurrection that would eventually come.

It ends here, in the ashes. Drinking myself to death in a Toronto apartment. Hearing demons. Hoping not to wake up.

It ends at the breaking point.

Because you cannot understand the resurrection without understanding the death. You cannot appreciate the light without experiencing the darkness. You cannot grasp what was healed without knowing how deep the wound went.

What follows—Volume Two and beyond—is the story of climbing out. Three rehabs. Nancy's impossible faith. Marriage and children. Eight years of sobriety that still couldn't touch the core wound. Corporate success and crushing collapse. And finally, finally, the sacred encounter that changed everything.

But those stories require their own telling.

For now, I want you to sit with this.

A man at the end of himself. A prodigal in the furthest reaches of the far country. An empire builder surrounded by sand.

The chapter is called "The Breaking Point" because something had to break before something new could be born.

The breaking point was not the end of my story.

It was the end of one story—the story I had been telling myself since I left home at sixteen.

And the beginning of another—the story of how a lost traveler found his way home.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Perhaps you're at your own breaking point.*

*Perhaps the towers you've built are falling, or have already fallen. Perhaps the medication—whatever form it takes—has stopped working. Perhaps you've achieved everything you set out to achieve and discovered that it was sand.*

*Perhaps the voices have started. The despair. The emptiness so profound that death seems like relief.*

*I need you to know something:*

*This is not the end.*

*The breaking point is not the final point. It is a threshold. A door that opens into something else.*

*The darkness you're experiencing is not proof that you're beyond saving. It's proof that the old life can no longer contain you. It's proof that what you've been building wasn't meant to stand. It's proof that transformation is necessary.*

*The breaking point is where resurrection begins.*

*Not immediately. Not easily. The climb out of the pit is brutal, and I would be lying if I told you otherwise.*

*But the breaking is not the breaking of *you*. It's the breaking of everything that was never really you—the covenants, the masks, the personas, the towers of performance.*

*What remains after the breaking is what was always there, underneath.*

*The child who was born into blessing.*

*The soul that was never destroyed.*

*The garden that has been waiting all along.*

*If you are at the breaking point, hold on.*

*Not to the old life—let that go.*

*Hold on to the voice that whispers through the chaos: "This is not the end. There is more. You were made for something else."*

*That voice is telling the truth.*

*And the story it wants to tell is barely beginning.*
