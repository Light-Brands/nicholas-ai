# Chapter Four
## The Prodigal's Departure

---

*Age 15-16*

---

I was a bomb waiting to explode.

The abuse had laid the foundation. The heartbreak had poured gasoline. And now, as I neared my sixteenth birthday, all that was needed was a match.

My father struck it without knowing.

---

## The Half-Brother

Someone showed up at my father's car dealership. A teenage boy, standing at the reception desk, asking to speak with Jeff Courchesne.

My father walked out, expecting a customer.

"Hello," he said. "How may I help you?"

The boy looked up at him with eyes that mirrored his own.

"Hello, Dad."

---

## The Truth Revealed

Before his conversion—before the Sunday when I, as a four-year-old prophet, had told him he needed Jesus—my father had lived a different life. A double life.

He had been honest with my mother about this history. She knew about the affairs. She knew there might be children. When she forgave him at the foot of the cross, she forgave *all* of it.

"Who am I not to forgive?" she said when I later confronted her. "I have been completely forgiven by Jesus. My responsibility is to extend that forgiveness to my husband and love toward that young boy."

But no one had told me.

I had grown up worshipping my father. He was my best friend, my hero, the man who had changed his entire life when God called. The man who left the darkness of nightlife to become a faithful husband and devoted father.

Now I learned he had fathered another child. A son. A half-brother I had never known.

And something in me snapped.

---

## The Rage

I became extremely angry.

The emotion was larger than the trigger deserved—but that's how trauma works. The anger I felt about my father's affair was genuine, but it was amplified a hundredfold by the rage I had never expressed about the abuse. By the fury I had swallowed after the heartbreak. By years of suppression finally finding an outlet.

All the questions I couldn't ask about God's failure to protect me now became accusations against my father.

*How could he have lied?*

*How could he have pretended to be something he wasn't?*

*How could the same house that preached integrity contain such a secret?*

The hypocrisy—real or perceived—gave me permission to abandon everything I had been taught.

If the adults could live double lives, so could I.
If the saints could hide sins, then sin wasn't really sin.
If my father could pretend, then nothing was real.

---

## The Descent

What followed was a controlled demolition of my own life.

Wrong choice followed wrong choice. Each one designed to numb the pain. Each one proving that I was beyond redemption—and therefore didn't need to try.

I started hanging out with a different crowd. Harder. Older. Kids who didn't flinch at the things that made church kids gasp.

I experienced drugs beyond alcohol. Marijuana led to ecstasy led to cocaine led to whatever was available on any given night.

I had sex with multiple girls—girls I didn't care about, whose hearts I would damage without remorse. If love equaled suffering, then I would be the one who caused suffering. I would be the predator, not the prey.

And the entrepreneur in me saw an opportunity.

---

## The Drug Dealer

If everyone wanted drugs, someone had to sell them.

I connected the dots quickly. The profit margins were staggering. The demand was infinite. And the danger only made it more attractive—a way to prove I was fearless, that nothing could touch me, that I was the king of whatever jungle I entered.

Within months, I had built a small empire.

My parents were called to school weekly. Teachers reported fights, thefts, behavioral incidents that escalated each time. I was running with boys who would graduate to prison, who would overdose, who would die young in ways that seemed glamorous until they happened.

I didn't care.

I was making more money than my father. I was feared and respected by my peers. I was becoming exactly what I had sworn I would be: my own god.

The kingdom of Nicholas was being established, and its currency was destruction.

---

## Costa Rica

During my fourth year of high school, our school organized an exchange trip to Costa Rica. The stated goal was cultural immersion—learning Spanish, studying local customs, staying with host families.

I saw different opportunities.

Within a week, I had organized nightly escapes. Leading other students out of the houses where we were staying. Finding clubs. Getting high. Corrupting everyone I touched with the same darkness that was consuming me.

The teachers weren't foolish. They saw what was happening. And they made a decision that would prove prophetic:

They sent me home.

One week before the trip was supposed to end, I was on a plane back to Canada. Alone. In disgrace.

My parents picked me up from the Montreal airport. We drove two hours back to Gatineau in complete silence.

When I walked through the front door, I saw it immediately.

One pound of marijuana sitting on the kitchen table.

They had found my stash.

---

## The Ultimatum

My parents looked at me with something I had never seen before in their eyes.

Not anger—I could have handled anger. Not disappointment—that was expected.

It was *despair*.

The realization that their son—the child they had raised in prayer, the boy who had spoken prophecy, the miracle they had dedicated to God—was becoming something they didn't recognize.

The next day, my father sat me down.

His voice was steady, but I could hear the tremor beneath it. The effort it took to hold himself together.

"Son, I love you. But you have two choices."

He paused. Let the weight of what he was about to say settle.

"You can change your lifestyle and live under the values of this house. Or you can continue in your ways—but you will have to leave our home."

I looked at him. At this man who had been my hero. At the cracks in his armor that I had discovered. At the human being behind the father.

And I felt nothing but cold resolve.

---

## Just Watch Me

I went to my room. I packed my bags. Everything I needed fit into a single duffel.

I walked back through the kitchen, toward the door.

And then I stopped.

I turned around.

My father was standing by the counter. His face—God, I can still see his face. Love and anger and sadness and grief and fear all fighting for dominance. A father watching his son walk into destruction and being unable to stop it.

I looked directly into his eyes. And I spoke the words that would haunt me for decades. The words that would become the third covenant, the final piece of the unholy trinity that would govern my life:

*"One day you will hear about Nicholas Courchesne. I will succeed no matter what. Watch me."*

I turned around and walked out the door.

Just like the prodigal son.

Just like I was supposed to.

---

## The Third Covenant

*Just watch me.*

Three words. A lifetime of consequence.

What I was really saying was: *I don't need you. I don't need anyone. I will prove my worth through achievement so undeniable that everyone who ever doubted me will be forced to acknowledge my greatness.*

The covenant was this: **My value comes from what I accomplish, not from who I am.**

Add this to the other two:

**Love equals suffering.**

**I am my own god.**

**Just watch me.**

These three covenants—formed in abuse, crystallized in heartbreak, sealed in rebellion—would operate as the invisible software of my soul for the next twenty-nine years.

Every business I built: *Just watch me.*
Every million I made: *Just watch me.*
Every relationship I sabotaged: *Love equals suffering.*
Every person I refused to trust: *I am my own god.*

I was sixteen years old, standing on the porch of my childhood home, and I had just programmed the algorithm that would nearly kill me.

---

## The Criminal Record

The police had been watching me for months.

They knew about my operation. They had names, dates, suspicions they couldn't quite prove. When I was expelled from the international program and sent home from Costa Rica, they saw their opportunity.

They busted me at school—but by some miracle, I had no drugs on me that day. The case fell apart.

I took this as a sign. Not a warning to change, but confirmation that I was invincible. That I could do anything and escape consequence.

A small voice inside me—the last whisper of the child who used to pray—kept telling me to walk away. That my days were numbered. That prison was coming if I didn't change course.

For once, I listened.

I liquidated everything. Got out of the drug business. Never looked back at that particular chapter.

But the police weren't finished with me.

They caught me stealing rims from a car in a parking lot. And this time, they didn't let go.

They charged me with theft. They added charges for resisting arrest—charges that were fabricated, but who would believe a known drug dealer?

The judge had no mercy. Three felonies. Sixteen years old. Criminal record.

I had been branded before I was old enough to vote.

## Into the Wilderness

What does a sixteen-year-old prodigal do when he leaves home with a criminal record and a chip on his shoulder the size of a mountain?

He survives.

I moved in with friends. Couch to couch. Whatever it took. I tried legitimate work—minimum wage jobs that paid a fraction of what I had made dealing. I enrolled in college and discovered that I couldn't succeed there without studying, and I had no patience for studying.

I was fired from job after job. I didn't last more than a few weeks anywhere. The authority figures reminded me of my father, and I couldn't tolerate anyone telling me what to do.

One door after another closed.

And then a different door opened.

Friends of mine were working in the Toronto nightlife scene. Clubs, bars, VIP rooms. The money was good—not drug-dealer good, but better than minimum wage. And it fit who I was becoming: a creature of darkness, a prince of the night, someone who thrived when the sun went down.

I became a promoter. A host. A face that made people feel important, that opened doors to experiences they couldn't access on their own.

I was very good at it.

The skills I had developed—the charm, the manipulation, the ability to read people and give them what they wanted—all of it translated perfectly to this world.

Sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
No limits.
No boundaries.

I lived by night and slept by day.

And I told myself this was freedom.

This was what I had left home for.

This was the kingdom I was building.

---

## The Angel in the Darkness

In the midst of this descent, something unexpected happened.

I met Nancy.

She was beautiful—inside and out. She had a smile that could light up the darkest room, that reminded me of my grandmother, that made something in my frozen heart crack open just slightly.

We started going out.

And for the first time since the abuse, I found someone who could see past the persona. Someone who looked at the hardened drug dealer, the nightclub king, the rebel with the criminal record—and saw the little boy hiding underneath.

How could she see my heart? I had left it years ago, broken into pieces on the path of my life. I was cold and frozen. It felt like I didn't have a heart anymore.

But she saw it.

She saw *me*.

And it terrified me.

Because the covenant was clear: love equals suffering. Anyone who gets close will hurt you. Vulnerability is weakness.

So when she looked at me with those eyes that saw too much, I knew what I had to do.

I had to destroy it before it destroyed me.

---

## Nancy's Wisdom

But Nancy was smarter than I expected.

She saw what I was doing. She watched me sabotage, push back, create distance. And instead of fighting it—instead of trying to hold on—she did something that saved both of us:

She let me go.

"Nicholas, I really love you," she said. "But I believe you need to continue your journey by yourself and discover what you're looking for on your own."

She explained that what she had fallen in love with was my heart. The one I couldn't feel anymore. The one I didn't believe existed.

And then she said something that would echo through the next two decades:

*"One day, I will marry you."*

I was stunned.

Who would want to marry someone as broken as me? After getting to know the real me—the criminal, the addict, the performer, the destroyer—who would still say those words?

Was she the crazy one?

Or was she seeing something I couldn't see about myself?

We decided to stay friends. Best friends. Confidants.

And Nancy began a vigil that would last through years of my destruction. She would pray for me. She would believe in a future I couldn't imagine. She would hold a vision of the man I could become while I systematically dismantled myself.

She was the thread that never broke.

Even when I tried to cut it.

## The Prodigal Continues

This is where Volume I turns dark.

What follows is the full descent into the far country. New York City. Cocaine. Millions of dollars made in the shadows. September 11th. Business empires built on fractured foundations. The slow, grinding destruction of everything that matters.

I was sixteen when I left home.

I would not hit bottom until I was twenty-seven.

Eleven years of running. Eleven years of building towers. Eleven years of trying to prove that I could succeed without God, without family, without love.

*Just watch me.*

And the watching would be horrifying.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*Did you have your own prodigal moment? A departure from everything you were taught? A rebellion that felt like freedom but led to bondage?*

*Perhaps you, too, stood at the door of your childhood and made a vow. Perhaps you, too, declared independence from everyone who loved you. Perhaps you, too, believed that the wilderness was better than the garden.*

*Here is what the prodigal discovers, every time: the far country lies.*

*It promises freedom and delivers slavery. It promises fulfillment and delivers emptiness. It promises that you will finally become yourself, and instead you lose yourself entirely.*

*But here is the hope: the far country is not the end.*

*The prodigal comes home.*

*Not immediately. Not easily. Not without years of suffering and shame and the gradual realization that everything he built in the wilderness was sand.*

*But he comes home.*

*And when he does, the Father is waiting.*

*Not with judgment. Not with "I told you so." Not with conditions and probation and punishment.*

*With a ring. A robe. A feast.*

*With arms that never stopped waiting to embrace.*

*The far country is not the end, dear traveler.*

*It's just a very long detour on the way home.*
