# Chapter Three
## First Heartbreak, First Covenant

---

*Age 14-15*

---

The wound had been silent for years.

Buried so deep that I had almost convinced myself it wasn't there. I went through the motions of adolescence—school, church, family dinners—while something in me calcified into stone.

And then, at fourteen years old, I fell in love.

And everything I thought I had buried came roaring back to the surface, wearing a different face.

---

## The Girl Who Made Me Feel

Her name doesn't matter now. What matters is what she represented: the first person outside my family who made me feel *seen*.

She was beautiful in that way that makes a teenage boy forget how to breathe. But it was more than that. When she looked at me, something in my chest cracked open. The walls I had built after the abuse—the vigilance, the suspicion, the learned detachment—all of it dissolved in her presence.

For the first time in years, I felt something other than numb.

I had never experienced this type of emotion. I couldn't get her out of my mind. She was my first thought in the morning and my last thought at night. The world that had seemed gray suddenly erupted into color.

We started going out. My life became a love story. She knew I was different because of my upbringing, and she accepted me exactly as I was.

I was convinced—with the complete certainty that only a fourteen-year-old can muster—that she would become my wife. That we would live happily ever after. That love had finally found me.

I had no idea that I was walking directly into the confirmation of my deepest wound.

---

## The Unraveling

Love made me blind.

The values I had been raised with—the boundaries, the principles, the faith that had once been the bedrock of my identity—all of it began to erode. For her, I would do anything. For the feeling she gave me, I would sacrifice everything.

One night, I went to a party with her. A friend offered me a drink. I had never tasted alcohol before—it was strictly forbidden in my household, a gateway to destruction according to everything I had been taught.

But she was drinking. Everyone was drinking. And when the liquid touched my lips, something magical happened.

All my insecurities vanished. The constant vigilance that had exhausted me since the abuse—gone. The sense of being different, of not belonging, of carrying secrets too heavy to hold—all of it dissolved into a warm, amber haze.

For the first time in my life, I felt like I was part of the tribe.

I didn't know it then, but I had just met my second-greatest love. A love that would nearly kill me. A love that would own me for the next twenty years.

Alcohol had entered my bloodstream, and it felt like coming home.

---

## The Crossing of Lines

What followed happened quickly.

The alcohol lowered every defense I had built. The desire to feel connected, to be close, to dissolve the loneliness that had been my constant companion—it overwhelmed everything else.

I gave her my virginity. Convinced myself she was the one. Told myself that what we were doing was different because we were in love.

I started lying to my parents. Manipulating them into believing we were just friends. Building an entire architecture of deception to protect my access to this feeling.

Because that's what it was really about—the *feeling*. The relief from the chronic numbness. The momentary escape from the prison of my own walled-off heart.

She was not my salvation. She was my medication.

And I didn't know the difference.

---

## The Shattering

Nine months into our relationship, she sat me down.

I remember the exact moment. The look on her face—something between guilt and relief. The way she wouldn't quite meet my eyes.

"I don't love you anymore," she said. "I'm breaking up with you."

That's it. Those words. Simple and devastating.

My world shattered.

---

## The Descent

I had never experienced anything like the pain that followed.

Physical pain has limits. Your body can only hurt so much before shock sets in, before numbness takes over. But emotional anguish has no ceiling. It can keep intensifying, keep sharpening, keep carving you open until you wonder if there's anything left inside.

I couldn't breathe. My chest felt like it was caving in. I would wake in the middle of the night gasping, reaching for someone who wasn't there.

I became deeply, profoundly depressed.

For the first time in my life, I didn't want to live.

Not in an active, suicidal way—I wasn't planning anything. But the desire to exist simply evaporated. The world lost all color again, but this time it was worse than before because now I knew what color felt like. I knew what it was to feel alive.

And I had lost it.

## The Question That Breaks Faith

In the depths of my despair, a question formed. The question that has broken the faith of countless believers. The question that God seems to allow precisely because He knows we must wrestle with it:

*How could a good God allow His child to suffer this much?*

I had been taught that God was love. That He protected His children. That faith was rewarded with blessing.

But here I was—a boy who had been violated for three years under the roof of His own church, now destroyed by the first person he had allowed himself to love.

Where was the protection? Where was the blessing? Where was the good God who supposedly loved me?

The theodicy broke me.

I had no sophisticated theological framework to make sense of suffering. I only knew that I hurt more than I thought possible, and the God I had been taught to trust had done nothing to prevent it.

The seeds of rebellion that had been planted during the abuse—the suspicion of religious authority, the sense that something was fundamentally wrong with what I'd been taught—now sprouted into a dark forest.

---

## The Covenant Crystallizes

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is a choice.

That day, I chose to suffer.

Not consciously—I didn't have the self-awareness to recognize the choice I was making. But in the cauldron of that anguish, a covenant formed that would govern my life for the next three decades:

*I will never let myself fall in love again.*

*I will never let myself suffer like this again.*

You see the logic, don't you? The terrible, self-protective logic of a wounded heart?

If love leads to suffering, then avoid love.
If vulnerability leads to destruction, then never be vulnerable.
If opening your heart means having it shattered, then seal it shut forever.

The covenant I had formed during the abuse—*love equals suffering*—was now reinforced with iron. The abuse had taught me that intimacy leads to violation. This heartbreak taught me that love leads to abandonment.

Two data points. Same conclusion.

Love is not safe.
Love will destroy you.
Protect yourself at all costs.

## Turning from God

And there was one more piece. One more covenant that formed in the crucible of that pain.

I turned my back on God.

Not with a formal declaration—I was too young for that kind of dramatic gesture. But something in me shifted. The child who had spoken prophecy at four, who had preached to his family with a whiteboard, who had dreamed of touching billions for the Kingdom—that child died.

In his place stood someone harder. Someone who looked at the universe and saw not a loving Father but an absent landlord. An indifferent force. A God who had failed to protect him when protection was most needed.

If this is God, I thought, then I will be my own god.

I didn't have the words for it then. But I had just crowned myself sovereign of my own life. I had just declared independence from any higher power. I had just begun the descent that would take me to the gates of hell.

---

## What I Know Now

Looking back with the clarity of transformation, I can see what I couldn't see then:

The girl was not the point.

She was a catalyst—a trigger that activated wounds already festering in my soul. The abuse had primed me for this collapse. The covenant *love equals suffering* was already written; she simply proved it true.

This is how trauma works. It creates a lens through which we interpret all subsequent experience. It whispers confirmation every time life delivers pain. It says *see? I told you so* with every heartbreak, every betrayal, every abandonment.

The girl didn't break me. The abuse broke me. She just exposed the fracture.

And I know something else now:

The pain I felt was real and valid. A fourteen-year-old's heartbreak is not a small thing. The emotions were genuine, the suffering sincere. I'm not dismissing what I experienced.

But the *conclusions* I drew from that pain were the problem. The covenants I made in the fire were not wisdom—they were survival mechanisms. And survival mechanisms kept running long after the crisis has passed become prisons.

I spent thirty years being faithful to covenants I never consciously made. Thirty years pushing away anyone who might love me. Thirty years proving to myself, over and over, that love was dangerous and vulnerability was weakness.

Until I finally faced the one who made those covenants—that terrified, heartbroken, fourteen-year-old boy—and released him from promises that were never meant to last forever.

## The Fork in the Road

This was the moment when my story could have gone differently.

The pain could have driven me deeper into faith. I could have found an adult to confide in, a mentor who might have helped me process what I was experiencing. I could have discovered that suffering shared is suffering halved, that community can hold what the individual cannot.

Instead, I chose isolation.
Instead, I chose self-reliance.
Instead, I chose to harden.

I don't tell you this with judgment. That boy was doing the best he could with the resources he had. He was already carrying an unbearable secret—the abuse he couldn't speak of. Adding another layer of pain was simply too much.

He did what traumatized people do: he protected himself in the only ways he knew how.

But protection became prison.

And the prison was only beginning to be built.

---

## The Path Forward

Within months of this heartbreak, everything would accelerate.

I would discover that my father had other children from affairs before his conversion. This revelation would shatter my image of him as the perfect Christian man and add another layer of confusion to my already-fractured faith.

I would begin experimenting with drugs beyond alcohol. I would find that these substances could silence the pain even more effectively than the first drink had.

I would start running with a different crowd. Making money in ways that would give me a criminal record before I turned seventeen.

I would become someone my parents no longer recognized. Someone I no longer recognized.

And at sixteen years old, I would stand at the door of my childhood home with a packed bag and a vow on my lips:

*"One day you will hear about Nicholas Courchesne. I will succeed no matter what. Watch me."*

The prodigal son was about to depart.

The wilderness was waiting.

And the covenants I had made in pain would guide me deeper into darkness than I ever imagined possible.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*What covenants did you make in your moments of greatest pain?*

*What silent vows—formed in the fires of heartbreak, betrayal, abandonment—are still governing your life today?*

*These covenants often hide in plain sight. They masquerade as wisdom: "I'll never trust anyone completely." "I'll never let myself be vulnerable again." "I'll always keep part of myself protected."*

*They feel like strength. They present themselves as lessons learned.*

*But they are prisons.*

*The work of transformation includes identifying these covenants, bringing them into the light, and asking: Does this still serve me? Was this ever true? Is there a better way to live?*

*You made those vows in survival mode. You made them when you were desperate and had no other options.*

*You have options now.*

*The covenants can be broken. The prison doors can open. The heart can learn, even after decades of evidence to the contrary, that love does not have to equal suffering.*

*But first, you have to see the chains.*

*First, you have to admit they exist.*
