# Chapter One
## Born Into Blessing

---

*December 15, 1980*

---

I entered this world already marked.

Not by trauma—that would come later. Not by darkness—that was waiting in the wings. I was marked by light. By prayer. By the fierce, unrelenting love of a grandmother who understood that some battles are won on our knees before they are ever fought in the world.

My grandmother raised me until I was four years old. While my mother climbed the corporate ladder as assistant director of the National Bank, and my father split his days between teaching ski and tending bar, this woman—this warrior in an apron—poured the foundation of my soul.

She didn't just love me. She *consecrated* me.

Every morning began with prayer. Every evening ended with Scripture. She spoke to God as if He were sitting across the kitchen table, and I grew up believing He was. Miracles weren't stories from ancient texts—they were Tuesday. They were the check that arrived in the exact amount needed when the mortgage was due. They were the unexplained healings, the answered prayers, the constant supernatural fingerprints pressed into the fabric of our daily lives.

I learned to breathe in an atmosphere of the sacred. And that breath would sustain me through decades of drowning.

## The Transformation

When I was approaching four years old, something shifted in our household. My mother had an encounter with the Divine that would alter the trajectory of our entire family.

She met God.

Not the concept of God. Not the religious ritual of God. She met Him—alive, speaking, inviting her into a new story. And He asked her to make a sacrifice that the world would call foolish: leave her prestigious career and come home to raise her son in His ways.

She said yes.

My father didn't understand. How could he? He watched his wife transform before his eyes—trading power lunches for prayer meetings, corporate strategy for Scripture study. He was disturbed, confused, perhaps even afraid.

But my mother had faith that what God unites, He does not separate. She would bring me to Bible studies every Friday night and Sunday morning, believing that her husband would eventually follow.

She was right. But the turning point came through an unlikely prophet.

Me.

## The Words That Changed Everything

I was playing with toys on the kitchen floor. My father sat at the table, eating a late dinner, exhausted from a long day. I was four years old—too young to understand theology, too innocent to comprehend the weight of eternal matters.

But something rose up in me that night. Something that used my small voice but came from a place far deeper than my years.

I stood up from my toys. I walked to the table. I climbed onto the chair beside my father, looked directly into his eyes, and spoke words that I did not choose:

*"If you don't accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior in your heart, you will go to hell. But if you do, you will come to heaven with Mommy and me."*

Then I climbed down and went back to my toys.

My father sat frozen, fork suspended in mid-air, staring at the space where I had been. He would later tell me that in that moment, he knew the words had not come from his little boy. They had come *through* him.

The following Sunday, my father came to church with us. He gave his life to Jesus Christ. And everything changed.

## A Home Transformed

The shift was immediate and total.

My father left the nightlife industry—the bars, the late nights, the lifestyle that had once defined him. He became a car salesman. The income dropped dramatically. Where two salaries had once flowed, now only one trickled in.

But here is what still amazes me, even now: we never lived poor-minded.

We trusted God. Not as a theological concept, but as a daily practice. And He showed up. Again and again and again.

I remember one month when my parents counted the bills and counted their money and came up short. Not just a little short—significantly short. They didn't have enough to cover the mortgage. They didn't have enough for gas to get my father to work the next day.

They prayed. Not the polite prayers of comfortable Christians, but the desperate prayers of people who have nowhere else to turn.

The next day, a knock came at the door.

A man stood on our porch, envelope in hand. He said he felt prompted—by what, he couldn't fully explain—to give our family a specific amount of money.

The check was exactly enough to cover the mortgage, plus twenty dollars for gas.

This was not an isolated incident. This was our life. The supernatural wasn't a category of experience reserved for saints and mystics. It was the air we breathed. Miracles were the grammar of our household.

## The Formation of a Warrior

My childhood was filled with motion, with challenge, with the constant push to expand my limits.

My father became my best friend. Hours disappeared as we played together—building treehouses, constructing hockey rinks in the backyard, engineering skateboard ramps from scrap wood. We went swimming, played tennis, learned karate, scaled rock faces.

We had no television. The absence that most would call deprivation, I now recognize as liberation. Without screens to consume our attention, we were forced to create. To imagine. To engage with the world rather than watch simulations of it.

My mother was the wild one. Where my father provided steady presence, she provided adventure. She would push me past my comfort zones, whispering encouragement as I faced fears that seemed insurmountable. *You can do this. You're capable of more than you know.*

And every morning, every night, we would gather as a family to read Scripture, to pray, to worship. Before each meal, we gave thanks. Not as ritual—as recognition. We knew where our blessings came from.

My mother would come to my bedside each night, and we would recite three verses from the Bible together. I can still hear her voice. I can still feel the blankets tucked around me. I can still recite those verses from memory, decades later, because they were pressed into my soul when it was still soft enough to receive them.

## The Gift Awakens

The gift of communication found me early.

I would gather my parents and grandmother into a circle, arm myself with a small whiteboard, and preach. I would teach them what I had learned in Sunday school, complete with hand-drawn diagrams and emphatic gestures. I was seven years old, and I was already standing before an audience, speaking truths I barely understood but somehow knew were important.

This was the first stirring of a calling that would take decades to fully unfold. The same gift that would one day help me build business empires. The same gift that would one day seduce crowds in nightclubs. The same gift that would one day, finally, be surrendered to its original purpose.

But I didn't know any of that then. I just knew I had something to say, and people seemed to want to listen.

## Dreams Too Big for Religion

My eagerness to connect with God burned at an all-time high. I had dreams—vivid, overwhelming dreams—of traveling the world, preaching Jesus, becoming a missionary who would touch millions.

But even then, something in me refused the poverty narrative I saw in ministry. The idea that serving God meant struggling financially felt wrong in my spirit. I was an entrepreneur before I knew the word. I sold hockey lessons to neighborhood kids for twenty-five cents a session. I was eight years old, and I was already building my first business.

Surely there was a way to serve God and create abundance. Surely the Kingdom wasn't built on scarcity.

I remember the first time I learned that billionaires existed. Not just millionaires—*billionaires*. Something shifted in my chest. A recognition. A knowing.

The following Sunday, an older woman at church asked me the question adults love to ask children: "Nicholas, what do you want to become when you grow up?"

I answered without hesitation: "Madame, I will become a billionaire."

Her face tightened. "Well, you know, Nicholas, that money is the root of all evil."

"No, Madame," I replied. "The *love* of money is the root of all evil. How can I bless millions of people if I don't make billions of dollars?"

Silence.

I was twelve years old. And I had just articulated a vision that the religious structure around me could not contain.

## The Shadow of Suppression

The church we attended had beautiful Bible studies and genuine devotion. But it was also deeply religious—bound by doctrines that I now believe do not reflect the heart of God.

Every time I shared my dreams of entrepreneurship and abundance, I was met with the same response: *Those dreams are not from God. They are from the world.*

The suppression of what I felt was my purpose created a confusion that would fester for years. How could the calling I felt so deeply be dismissed so completely? How could the fire in my chest be extinguished by people who claimed to know the God who put it there?

This was the first fracture—not in my innocence, but in my trust. The realization that religious people could be wrong. That following rules wasn't the same as following God.

I didn't have the language for it then. But a seed of rebellion was planted. A seed that would grow into something monstrous before it could finally be transformed.

## The Blessing and the Burden

Looking back now, I understand something I couldn't grasp as a child:

I was being prepared.

Every prayer my grandmother prayed over me was ammunition for battles I hadn't yet faced. Every Scripture my mother pressed into my heart was a lifeline I would desperately need when I was drowning. Every miracle I witnessed was evidence I would cling to when all other evidence pointed toward despair.

I was born into blessing. This is undeniable. The love that surrounded me, the faith that saturated my childhood, the supernatural reality that was my normal—these were gifts beyond measure.

But blessing does not inoculate against suffering. Light does not prevent darkness from coming.

And the darkness was coming.

It was already there, waiting in the shadows of a church where I was supposed to be safe. Wearing the face of someone I was supposed to trust.

The wounds that would define the next three decades of my life were not inflicted by strangers. They were not random acts of violence. They were calculated violations, repeated over years, hidden beneath the veneer of Christian community.

And they would teach me a lie I would believe with every fiber of my being:

*Love equals suffering.*

But I didn't know that yet. Not in these golden years, when miracles were daily bread and my grandmother's prayers covered me like armor.

I was born into blessing.

And I was about to be broken.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Before you were wounded, you were whole. Before you learned to perform, you simply were. Before the covenants and the masks and the towers you built to hide behind—there was a child who knew they were loved.*

*That child is still there. Buried, perhaps. Forgotten, certainly. But never destroyed.*

*As you read Nicholas's story, I invite you to remember your own beginning. What were the blessings of your early years? Who prayed for you before you knew you needed prayer? What dreams did you carry before the world told you they were too big?*

*The garden of your soul was planted long ago. The journey home begins with remembering it exists.*
