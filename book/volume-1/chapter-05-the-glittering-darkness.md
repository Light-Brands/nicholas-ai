## The Glittering Darkness

---

*Ages 17-21*

---

The night has its own kingdom.

Most people only visit—a weekend excursion into the hours after midnight, a temporary vacation from the daylight world of responsibility and consequence.

But I became a permanent resident.

I became a prince of the shadows. A creature who thrived in the darkness. Someone who saw the sun rise not as a beginning, but as a signal to finally sleep.

This is the story of how I built an empire in the night.

And how that empire owned me far more than I ever owned it.

## Toronto: The Apprenticeship

The Toronto nightlife scene in the late 1990s was electric.

Money flowed like water. VIP rooms glittered with bottles and bodies. The elite of the city—the athletes, the actors, the entrepreneurs—all converged on the same clubs, seeking the same escape from the same emptiness.

I recognized that emptiness. I carried it inside me.

But where they came to temporarily escape, I came to profit. I understood something that most people miss: the night trades in feeling, not product. People don't pay for alcohol—they pay for the emotion that alcohol unlocks. They don't pay for access—they pay for the sense of importance that access provides.

I became a dealer in emotions.

My job was to make people feel special. To remember their names. To secure the table that said they had arrived. To provide the experience that let them believe, for a few hours, that they were exactly who they pretended to be.

I was very, very good at it.

Within months, I was making more money than I had ever dreamed. The skills I had honed as a drug dealer—reading people, understanding desire, providing escape—translated perfectly to this legitimate (or semi-legitimate) industry.

But Toronto was just the training ground.

The real game was being played in New York.

## The Big Apple

A friend told me about his contacts in Manhattan. The numbers he quoted seemed impossible. Promoters there were making three or four times what we made in a single night.

At eighteen years old, I boarded a plane to New York City.

I had no idea what I was walking into.

I only knew that "Just watch me" was still burning in my chest, and New York was the biggest stage I could find.

## The City That Never Sleeps

New York in the early 2000s was the center of the universe.

The clubs were temples to excess. The money was obscene. The cocaine was everywhere—not hidden in back rooms or whispered about in code, but consumed openly, casually, the same way someone might order another drink.

This is where I met my new best friend.

Cocaine.

It was completely normalized. Everyone was using. The beautiful people, the powerful people, the people whose names appeared in magazines—they all had the same white powder on their fingertips.

And when I first felt it enter my bloodstream, I understood why.

The drug made me feel invincible. Every insecurity, every fear, every whisper of inadequacy—silenced. The shy boy who had been abused, the heartbroken teenager, the prodigal son with the criminal record—all of it vanished behind a wall of chemical confidence.

I was Superman. Fearless. Untouchable.

The persona I had been building for years suddenly had pharmaceutical support.

## The Millionaire

I was extremely good-looking. Fit. Full of charm. Highly manipulative. I knew how to work the game better than almost anyone.

I climbed the ladder of the night with terrifying speed.

VIP hosting led to management. Management led to partnerships. The money I made, I invested—real estate, businesses, opportunities that presented themselves to someone with cash and no fear.

By twenty-one years old, I had made more than one million dollars.

Self-made. No inheritance. No assistance.

I owned property in Canada. I rented a penthouse on 45th Street and 10th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen. I drove a brand-new Corvette, the latest model year, parading through the streets like the king I believed myself to be.

I had five-star restaurants on speed dial. VIP access to every club that mattered. A buffet of beautiful women who would do anything to be part of the glamour.

I had everything the world tells you to want.

And I had never been more empty in my life.

---

## The Emptiness

This was the cruelest discovery of my young life.

I had believed—truly believed—that achieving these things would make me whole. That the ache inside me would be filled by success. That if I just made enough money, had enough sex, gained enough status, the wound would finally close.

It didn't.

If anything, it widened.

The emptiness became louder the more I had. The silence between parties grew more deafening. The moments alone—rare as they were—became unbearable.

I was supposed to feel fulfilled. Happy. Complete.

Instead, I felt alone.
Scared.
Wanting more.

This was not how it was supposed to feel.

So I did what any self-medicating addict would do: I increased the dosage. More cocaine. More alcohol. More women. More parties. More money. More.

If the medicine wasn't working, surely the problem was that I wasn't taking enough.

## The Voice That Wouldn't Die

Even in the depths of this lifestyle, something strange persisted.

My friends—the ones who shared my nights, who consumed the same substances, who lived the same life—they experienced hangovers. The physical aftermath of hard nights.

But for me, it was different.

After the drugs wore off, my soul would twist in agony. Not just physical sickness, but something deeper—a spiritual torment that had no name. It felt like demons were battling for my life.

A voice inside me kept speaking. The same voice I had tried to silence for years. The voice that sounded like the child who had once preached to his family with a whiteboard.

*You are running from your destiny.*

*These choices will cost you your life.*

*This is not who you were made to be.*

I hated that voice. I feared that voice. I used every substance I could find to drown it.

But it never fully died.

What I realize now is that I was fighting the nature of God within me—twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, fifty-two weeks a year. The Spirit that had been planted in me during those early years, watered by my grandmother's prayers and my mother's faith—it refused to be extinguished.

God was pursuing me through the darkness.

And I was running as fast as I could.

## September 11th, 2001

I was in a taxi, heading downtown.

It was early morning—unusual for me, but I had business that required daylight hours. My friend sat beside me as the driver navigated through Manhattan traffic.

The radio was on. The driver mentioned casually that a plane had hit one of the Twin Towers.

We thought he was crazy. New York had its share of mentally unstable people. Why would we believe something so absurd?

Then we heard another sound—a roar above us, the scream of engines pushed beyond their limits.

The radio host's voice cracked. The second tower had just been hit. The United States was under attack.

We were in complete disbelief.

The taxi dropped us off, and we looked up at a scene from a nightmare. Black smoke billowed from the towers, darkening the sky. In the distance, we could see figures falling—people jumping from the upper floors, choosing one death over another.

Against all logic, we started walking toward the towers.

My friend—who was from the Middle East and understood things I didn't—grabbed my arm.

"We need to turn around. Those planes probably had bombs. Those towers are going to come down."

"That's impossible," I said. "These are the Twin Towers. You're crazy."

We kept walking.

Six blocks from ground zero, the impossible happened.

The first tower collapsed.

A wall of smoke and debris rushed toward us like a living thing. We turned and ran. Ran for our lives through streets suddenly filled with screaming people and falling ash.

When we finally stopped, we were covered in gray dust. Behind us, where the towers had stood, there was only smoke and destruction.

Later that afternoon, walking through Times Square, the city was silent enough to hear birds flying.

I looked around at the ash-covered strangers, at the shock written on every face, at a world that had just changed forever.

And I asked myself: Why was I here? Did God have a message for me? What was I supposed to learn from standing at the edge of this apocalypse?

I had no answers.

Only more questions.

And more darkness waiting.

## The Aftermath

The months after 9/11 were brutal.

The city felt dead. The party stopped—not permanently, but the energy had shifted. Fear hung over everything. Work became harder to find. Security measures made moving between countries complicated.

And the money—the lifeblood of my lifestyle—became much harder to transfer.

I made a decision. I would move to New York permanently. Canada would become a holiday destination, a place to visit when immigration allowed.

The party would continue. The empire would keep growing. The night would keep claiming me.

Nothing—not even the collapse of the most famous buildings in the world—would stop me from proving what I had sworn to prove.

*Just watch me.*

---

## The Cost

Let me be clear about what this lifestyle took from me.

Not just the physical toll—the liver damage, the sleep deprivation, the neurological impact of constant drug use. Those were real, but they would heal eventually.

The spiritual and emotional cost was much higher.

Every night I spent in the clubs was a night I spent reinforcing my persona. The mask grew thicker. The act became more convincing. Until I couldn't tell where the performance ended and I began.

Every woman I used was a woman I treated as an object—and in doing so, I trained myself to see all intimacy as transactional. The capacity for genuine connection atrophied from disuse.

Every line of cocaine was a vote cast against my own soul. A declaration that the present moment was unbearable, that I needed chemical alteration to exist, that reality itself was the enemy.

And every dollar I made in the darkness carried a weight that money made in daylight doesn't carry. Not illegal—not anymore—but not clean either. Not earned in a way that builds something good.

I was becoming wealthy while becoming bankrupt.

Gaining the world while losing myself.

Exactly as the Scripture had warned.

## The Thread That Held

Through all of this, Nancy remained.

We had agreed to stay friends when she released me to continue my journey. And friends we stayed—but it was more than that. She was my confessor, my confidant, the one person who knew the worst of what I was doing and somehow still saw the best in who I might become.

She was working in the nightlife scene too, by this point. She had her own reasons—supporting her brothers, escaping her own broken home—but she hated what it required of her.

She would pray. Every morning. Every night. Getting on her knees in whatever apartment we shared, reading her Bible, connecting with the God I had abandoned.

Her faith in what seemed invisible kept something alive in me that should have died.

She loved me through the darkness. Not enabling me—she would confront my worst behavior—but never giving up on me. Never letting go of the vision of who I could become.

She said she would marry me one day.

I thought she was crazy.

I didn't know she was prophetic.

## What I Know Now

Looking back at this period with the eyes of someone transformed, I see what I couldn't see then:

I was medicating.

The drugs, the alcohol, the sex, the money, the status—all of it was medication for wounds I refused to acknowledge. Every hit of cocaine was a bandage over the abuse. Every VIP table was a throne to sit on because I didn't believe I deserved to be loved for who I was.

The glittering darkness wasn't an adventure. It was an anesthetic.

And anesthesia works. That's the terrible truth. It does numb the pain. It does make the unbearable bearable.

But it doesn't heal anything. The wound stays open beneath the numbness, festering, growing, preparing for the day when the medication stops working.

That day was coming.

Six more years of building. Six more years of towers rising on sand.

And then the breaking point.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*What have you used to medicate your pain?*

*Maybe not cocaine—but something. We all have our anesthetics. Work. Achievement. Relationship. Food. Exercise. Religion. Shopping. Social media. The specific substance or behavior matters less than the function it serves.*

*Are you numbing something you refuse to feel?*

*Is there a wound beneath your performance that you've never examined?*

*There's no judgment here. Medication is a survival strategy. When the pain is great enough and the resources are limited enough, we do what we must to get through the day.*

*But survival isn't living.*

*And anesthesia isn't healing.*

*At some point, if we want to become whole, we have to let the medication wear off. We have to feel what we've been running from. We have to face the wound instead of covering it.*

*This is terrifying work. No one should do it alone.*

*But it's the only way home.*

*The glittering darkness promises everything and delivers nothing.*

*The garden you've forgotten—the one planted in your soul before trauma taught you to flee—it's still there. Waiting.*

*Overgrown, perhaps.*

*But not destroyed.*

*Never destroyed.*
