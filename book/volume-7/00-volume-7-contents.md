### Volume Summary

This final volume turns the focus outward. Nicholas's personal transformation is complete—but wholeness is not the destination. Wholeness is the foundation.

The wounds that nearly destroyed Nicholas have become the doors through which others will find healing. The journey that seemed like destruction was actually preparation for a global mandate: to help lost travelers find their way home to the garden.

This volume reveals the vision of thirty or more Transformational Epicenter locations around the world, the strategy for eradicating generational spirits of bondage, and the completion of Nancy's sacred contract—from loving Nicholas into awakening to awakening others together.

The series concludes with an invitation: What is the healing you have received that you are now called to become for others?
