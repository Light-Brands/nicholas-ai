## The Ambassador's Walk

---

*"Living as Embodiment, Not Just Teacher"*

---

An ambassador does not merely speak for their kingdom.

An ambassador embodies their kingdom.

They carry the culture, the values, the reality of home with them wherever they go. When people encounter an ambassador, they encounter—in some measure—the nation they represent.

I am an ambassador.

Not a teacher who explains transformation.

An ambassador who embodies it.

---

## The Difference Between Teacher and Ambassador

Teachers transmit information.

Ambassadors transmit presence.

A teacher can explain the mechanics of transformation—the principles, the practices, the processes. This teaching is valuable. But information alone does not transform.

An ambassador carries transformation in their being. When they enter a room, something shifts. When they speak, there is an authority that comes not from knowledge but from lived experience. When they are present, others begin to sense what is possible.

The teacher says: "Here is how transformation works."

The ambassador says, without words: "I am what transformation produces."

Both are needed. But the world is full of teachers and hungry for ambassadors.

## What I Carry

Let me tell you what I carry as an ambassador.

**The presence of someone who has been destroyed and rebuilt.** I know the bottom. I know the shame of complete failure. I know what it is to lose everything that matters. And I know the resurrection that follows total surrender. This experience is in my cells, in my eyes, in my handshake.

**The authority of tested truth.** Every principle I teach has been tested in my life. Not in comfortable circumstances but in crisis. The truth about identity, about Divine Order, about the Trinitarian Self—these are not theories I read about. They are realities I clung to when everything else was falling away.

**The peace that survives the storm.** There is a peace available that is not dependent on circumstances. I carry this peace. Not perfectly—I still have anxious moments, still face challenges. But underneath the turbulence, there is a settled knowing that was forged in the fire. Others can feel this.

**The joy of the garden.** I remember the garden now. I live from home, not toward it. This changes everything—how I approach each day, how I face difficulty, how I relate to others. The joy is not performance. It is overflow from a source that does not run dry.

**The love that has transformed a marriage.** Nancy and I have walked through hell together. What we have now—the intimacy, the partnership, the genuine knowing—is testimony that marriages can be rebuilt. When couples see us together, they see what is possible for them.

## The Ambassador's Posture

How does an ambassador walk?

**With nothing to prove.** The old Nicholas was constantly proving—his worth, his competence, his value. The ambassador has nothing to prove. Identity is settled. Worth is established. There is no striving for position because position is known.

**With nothing to hide.** Ambassadors are transparent. My story is public—the addiction, the affairs, the mental health crises, the suicidal ideation. Nothing hidden. This transparency is not exhibitionism; it is freedom. What is exposed has no power to shame.

**With nothing to lose.** Fear of loss drives so much human behavior. The ambassador has already lost everything and discovered that what remained was everything that mattered. This freedom from fear creates a boldness that is not aggression but confidence.

**With everything to give.** Ambassadors are generous. Not transactionally—expecting return—but lavishly. The transformation I received was gift. The gift must flow through me to others. I am a conduit, not a reservoir.

This posture is not performance.

It is the natural result of genuine transformation.

## The Ambassador's Daily Practice

Embodiment requires practice.

Every day, I engage practices that keep me connected to the source:

**Morning Anchoring:** Before the day begins, I anchor in identity. Prayer, declaration, presence with the Divine. This is not religious obligation; it is essential maintenance of the connection that makes everything else possible.

**Divine Order Living:** Spirit first, then soul, then body. Every decision filtered through this order. What does the Spirit say? How does my soul respond? What does my body need? The order matters.

**Covenant Review:** Regular review of the old covenants and their replacements. Not because I need to be reminded but because the enemy constantly attempts to reinstate old agreements. Vigilance is required.

**Physical Stewardship:** The body is the temple that carries the ambassador. Exercise, nutrition, rest—these are not vanity but stewardship. The body that hosts transformation must be cared for.

**Marriage Investment:** Every day, some specific investment in the relationship with Nancy. Not just coexistence but active cultivation. The marriage is a primary testimony; it requires primary attention.

**Present Engagement:** Wherever I am, I practice being fully present. Not distracted by phones, not planning the next thing, not absent while physically there. Presence is how the ambassador serves.

**Evening Reflection:** What did today reveal? Where did I operate from old patterns? Where did transformation manifest? What does tomorrow require?

These practices are not burdensome.

They are the infrastructure that supports the embodiment.

## The Ambassador in Public

When I speak at conferences, meet with clients, or engage in business dealings, I am not taking off my ambassador identity.

I am carrying it into every room.

This does not mean I preach constantly or impose spirituality where it doesn't belong. It means:

**I bring the same person everywhere.** No compartmentalization. The Nicholas who prays in the morning is the Nicholas who negotiates in the afternoon. The integration is complete.

**I model what I teach.** If I teach about presence, I am present. If I teach about truth-telling, I tell the truth. If I teach about vulnerability, I am vulnerable. The teaching and the living are not separate.

**I watch for the hungry.** In every room, there are people who are dying inside. Their success masks their desperation. The ambassador's eye is trained to see them—not to exploit but to serve. When the moment is right, a door opens for conversation that can change a life.

**I resist the temptation to perform.** Old Nicholas loved the stage, the recognition, the applause. The ambassador must be cautious here. Teaching transformation while performing for approval undermines the message. The goal is impact, not recognition.

## The Ambassador at Home

The most important ambassadorship happens at home.

Perla and Maverick are not served by a father who transforms others while failing to transform their daily experience. Nancy is not served by a husband who speaks beautifully in public while being absent in private.

**At home, the transformation is tested.**

Can I be patient when children are difficult?

Can I be present when I'm exhausted?

Can I choose Nancy's wellbeing over my convenience?

Can I lead spiritually without becoming religiously oppressive?

Can I model for my children what healthy masculinity looks like?

These tests are harder than any conference stage.

The home is the proving ground. If the transformation is real, it shows up in the small moments of family life.

## The Cost of Ambassadorship

Being an ambassador carries costs.

**Loss of anonymity.** My story is public. The worst parts of my history are known. Privacy, in certain ways, has been forfeited in service of the message.

**Constant visibility.** People watch. They watch to see if I practice what I preach. They watch expecting either confirmation or hypocrisy. The scrutiny is constant.

**Loneliness of the role.** Ambassadors exist between worlds. I understand both the successful facade and the hidden desperation. I belong to both worlds and fully to neither. This creates a unique kind of loneliness.

**The weight of expectation.** Others project onto me their hopes, their needs, their expectations. I become a symbol as much as a person. Carrying this weight requires constant grounding in actual identity.

**The temptation of platform.** Visibility creates opportunities—for influence, for income, for expansion. The ambassador must constantly discern between kingdom opportunity and ego opportunity. They can look identical from the outside.

These costs are not complaints.

They are the price of the calling.

I pay them willingly.

## The Ambassador's Authority

Here is something I discovered:

There is an authority that comes from transformation that cannot be counterfeited.

When someone has genuinely walked through fire—when they carry the scars and the wisdom—they have authority to speak that no degree, no title, no certification can provide.

This authority does not depend on credentials.

It depends on experience.

The couples who sit across from me do not need to see my degrees. They need to see my marriage. They need to know that I have been where they are and that I found the way through.

The leaders who hire me do not need to see my resume. They need to feel the peace that I carry. They need to sense that here is someone who has achieved success, watched it nearly destroy everything, and found something better.

The lost travelers who find their way to me do not need my qualifications. They need my story. They need to know that the darkness they feel is not permanent, that the garden exists, that someone will guide them home.

This is the ambassador's authority.

It is not claimed.

It is recognized.

*Dear Traveler,*

*You too are an ambassador.*

*Perhaps you do not feel ready. Perhaps you think your transformation is incomplete, your healing insufficient, your wisdom inadequate.*

*But consider: who in your world is waiting for exactly what you have learned?*

*You do not need complete transformation to be an ambassador. You need only be a step ahead of those you serve. You need only carry what you have genuinely received.*

*The role is not about perfection. It is about presence.*

*Bring what you have. Bring who you have become. Bring the hard-won wisdom of your journey.*

*Someone in your world is dying inside.*

*Someone in your world needs to see what transformation looks like.*

*Someone in your world needs an ambassador.*

*You are someone.*
