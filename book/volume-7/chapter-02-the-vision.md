# Chapter Two
## The Vision

---

*"30+ Transformational Epicenter Locations Globally"*

---

The vision came in pieces.

Through prayer. Through the sacred encounters. Through conversations with Nancy and trusted advisors. Through the quiet knowing that grew louder as transformation deepened.

Thirty or more Transformational Epicenter locations around the globe.

Not just a ministry. Not just a business. Not just a network.

*Epicenters.* Places from which transformation radiates outward, changing everything they touch.

## What Is an Epicenter?

In geology, the epicenter is the point on the earth's surface directly above an earthquake's origin. It is the place where the impact is most concentrated, from which shockwaves radiate outward.

A Transformational Epicenter is similar.

It is a place where transformation is most concentrated—where people encounter the full possibility of healing and wholeness. And from that place, transformation radiates outward into families, communities, industries, and nations.

These are not treatment centers in the conventional sense.

Treatment centers focus on managing problems.

Epicenters focus on producing transformation.

The difference is profound.

## The Shape of the Vision

Here is what I see:

**Physical Locations:**
- Centers in multiple countries on multiple continents
- Each epicenter designed for intensive transformation work
- Residential programs and outpatient support
- Beautiful, healing environments that communicate value and possibility

**The Work:**
- Sacred medicine journeys for those called to that path
- Intensive therapeutic work
- Couples retreats and marriage renewal
- Leadership transformation intensives
- Integration support and ongoing community
- Training programs for those who will become guides themselves

**The Impact:**
- Thousands of couples with renewed marriages
- Thousands of leaders freed from burnout and emptiness
- Thousands of addicts who found not just sobriety but healing
- Generational patterns broken in countless family lines
- Communities of transformed people supporting each other

**The Network:**
- Each epicenter connected to the others
- Shared resources, training, and standards
- A global movement of transformation

## Why Thirty?

Thirty is not a precise number but a magnitude indicator.

Not one or two locations. Not a local ministry.

A global movement.

Thirty represents:
- Presence on multiple continents
- Capacity to serve thousands
- Critical mass for cultural impact
- Sustainability through diversity

The number may be more or less. God's vision often exceeds what we can initially comprehend. But "thirty or more" captures the scale: this is not a small dream.

## The Timeline

I do not know when this vision will be fully realized.

It may take decades. It may extend beyond my lifetime.

But the vision is not diminished by my uncertainty about timeline.

What matters is:
1. The vision is from God
2. I take the next steps in obedience
3. I trust God to build what He has shown me

I will not force the vision. I will not manufacture what only God can produce. I will steward what I have been given and trust Him with the rest.

Some seeds take years to grow.

Some trees take decades to mature.

The timeline is not mine to control.

The obedience is mine to give.

## The First Epicenter

Every global movement begins with one location.

The first Transformational Epicenter is already taking shape.

Not as a building—not yet. But as a practice. As a community. As a methodology being refined through real experience with real people.

Nancy and I are living the epicenter in our home, our family, our relationships. Every principle in this book series is being tested in our lives. Every framework is being proven or adjusted through practice.

The first location will emerge from this living laboratory.

It may be in North America. It may partner with existing clinics like Transcend. The exact form is still being revealed.

But the work has already begun.

## The Economics

Vision requires resources.

I am not naive about the financial dimension of this calling. Buildings cost money. Staff must be paid. Sacred medicines have costs. The infrastructure for a global network requires significant capital.

I believe God provides for what He ordains.

But provision does not fall from the sky. It flows through:

**Transformation Itself:**
- People who experience transformation become generous supporters
- The network will be partly funded by those who have been served

**Kingdom Economics:**
- Giving that comes from overflow rather than obligation
- Investment by those who share the vision
- Partnerships with aligned organizations

**Sustainable Models:**
- Each epicenter designed to be financially sustainable
- Revenue sufficient to serve those who can pay and subsidize those who cannot
- Not dependent on any single donor or funding source

**Wise Stewardship:**
- Careful management of resources
- Growth at a pace that maintains quality
- Saying no to opportunities that would compromise the mission

I trust that the resources will be provided as the vision is faithfully pursued.

## The Legacy Dimension

This vision is not just for now. It is generational.

When I am gone, the epicenters will remain.

The methodology will be documented, taught, and passed down.

The transformed lives will continue transforming other lives.

Perla and Maverick—my children—will inherit not just memories of their father but a living legacy. A network. A movement. Something that extends their parents' transformation forward into the future.

This is Kingdom building.

Not Nicholas building.

What I build must be capable of outlasting me.

*Dear Traveler,*

*What vision has God placed in your heart?*

*Not your career plans. Not your bucket list. Not your retirement dreams.*

*What Kingdom vision—what assignment that would serve others, advance God's purposes, and outlast your lifetime—has been planted in you?*

*Every great vision begins as a seed.*

*A seed that seems impossible when you look at what you currently have.*

*A seed that requires faith to even speak out loud.*

*What is your seed?*

*Speak it.*

*Write it.*

*Let it grow.*

*Vision is not given to those who have figured out how to accomplish it.*

*Vision is given to those who are willing to receive it and steward it faithfully.*

*Your vision is waiting.*
