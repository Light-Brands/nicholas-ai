# Chapter Seven
## Nancy's Sacred Contract Completed

---

*"From Loving Into Awakening to Awakening Others Together"*

---

Nancy had a sacred contract.

Before we married—before we even met—she had agreed to something. A divine assignment that she would not fully understand until she was deep within it, when backing out would mean abandoning not just a marriage but a calling.

Her contract: Love Nicholas into awakening.

This chapter marks the completion of that contract and the beginning of something new.

---

## The Contract Revealed

Nancy did not know, when she said "I do," what she was agreeing to.

She thought she was marrying a driven, successful, slightly complicated man who would provide a good life. She thought she was signing up for the normal challenges of marriage—differences to navigate, compromises to make, years of building a life together.

She had no idea she was signing up to love a man through addiction, through mental health crises, through infidelity, through years of darkness that would test every ounce of her strength.

But on some level, deeper than conscious choice, she had agreed.

Her soul knew what her mind did not.

She had come to love Nicholas into awakening.

---

## What the Contract Required

The contract required everything.

**Patience beyond human capacity.** To watch someone you love destroy themselves, destroy the marriage, destroy the family—and not leave. To believe in possibility when all evidence pointed to impossibility. To wait for awakening that might never come.

**Forgiveness that defied logic.** To forgive betrayals that should have been unforgivable. Not once but repeatedly. To choose the relationship over the righteous option of walking away. To extend grace when justice would have been easier.

**Faith when faith was foolish.** To pray for a man who gave little evidence of deserving prayer. To believe in a future that the present contradicted. To hold hope when hope seemed like delusion.

**Self-sacrifice that risked self-destruction.** Nancy poured herself out for our family, for our children, for me. The risk was that she would have nothing left. The risk was that she would lose herself in the attempt to save everyone else.

The contract asked more than any marriage should ask.

And Nancy fulfilled it.

## The Turning Point

There was a moment—Nancy speaks of it rarely, because the memory is still sacred—when she received confirmation.

During one of the darkest periods, when she was praying for guidance, for strength, for some sign that staying was the right choice, she received a word.

*Stay. This is the assignment. He will awaken.*

No timeline. No guarantee of how long. No promise that it would be easy.

Just the confirmation that she was where she was supposed to be, doing what she was supposed to do.

That word sustained her through everything that followed.

When friends counseled her to leave, she remembered the word.

When I gave her every reason to walk away, she remembered the word.

When her own pain screamed for escape, she remembered the word.

*Stay. This is the assignment. He will awaken.*

She stayed.

And I awakened.

## The Cost to Nancy

Let me be clear: the sacred contract cost Nancy enormously.

**Years of emotional trauma.** Living with an addict, living with mental health crisis, living with infidelity—these leave scars. Nancy carries wounds from those years that require their own healing.

**Loss of dreams.** The marriage she imagined was not the marriage she got. The early years, the building years, the years that should have been about growing together—many of those were lost to my dysfunction. She cannot get them back.

**Her own needs neglected.** So much energy went to managing crisis, protecting children, surviving my chaos, that Nancy's own development, her own dreams, her own needs were often deferred.

**Isolation.** Who could she tell? The shame of what was happening, the complexity of the situation, the stigma of staying—all of it created isolation. She carried burdens that few people understood.

The contract completion does not erase these costs.

It transforms them.

What was sacrifice becomes testimony.

What was loss becomes foundation.

What was suffering becomes qualification for ministry.

---

## The Contract Completed

When did the contract complete?

Not at one moment but through a process.

When I chose transformation over performance—really chose it, not just temporarily—the completion began.

When I went to the medicine, faced the demons, burned the covenants—the completion accelerated.

When I returned home changed, genuinely changed, and began living from revealed identity—the completion manifested.

When Nancy looked at me and saw not the man she had prayed for but the man she had prayed into being—the completion was evident.

The contract was complete.

She had loved me into awakening.

---

## What Remains

But here is the beautiful surprise: completion is not ending.

The sacred contract has evolved.

Nancy was contracted to love me into awakening. That assignment is complete.

Now we are contracted together for something new:

**To awaken others.**

Everything Nancy learned in those years of darkness—the patience, the faith, the perseverance, the wisdom—is not just for our story. It is for the couples who will come to us desperate for hope.

Nancy's experience qualifies her in ways that no training could provide.

She knows what it is to be the spouse of someone lost in darkness.

She knows the isolation, the shame, the exhaustion.

She knows the questions: Should I stay? Am I enabling? Is there hope?

She knows the answer she received and the cost of obeying it.

Who better to walk with wives whose husbands are where I was?

Who better to counsel the confused, the hurt, the desperate?

Who better to offer hope that is not naive but tested?

## Our Partnership Now

The marriage that nearly ended is now the foundation of mission.

Nancy and I do not work separately—she handling her domain, I handling mine. We work together. The partnership that was forged in suffering is now deployed for service.

**In the epicenter work:**
- I work with the men, the leaders, the addicts, the broken
- Nancy works with the spouses, the partners, those left to carry the weight
- Together we work with couples, modeling what rebuilding looks like

**In our testimony:**
- My story is powerful, but incomplete without Nancy's
- Her perspective validates mine and extends it
- Together we offer what neither could offer alone

**In our family:**
- We parent together with shared vision
- The children see not just transformed father but transformed marriage
- The legacy we build is built together

This partnership is not just strategy. It is destiny.

We were always meant to do this together.

The dark years were preparation, not punishment.

## Nancy's Own Transformation

Here is something important: Nancy's transformation parallels mine.

While I was the obvious patient, the one in crisis, the one requiring intervention—Nancy was also being transformed.

The wife who entered this marriage has become someone new.

**Stronger.** What she survived has forged resilience that nothing can shake.

**Wiser.** She understands human nature, addiction, healing in ways that only experience teaches.

**Freer.** The co-dependence that could have defined her has been broken. She loves me freely now, not from obligation or fear.

**Clearer.** Her sense of calling, her understanding of purpose, her vision for the future—all refined through fire.

Nancy is not a supporting character in my story.

She is a protagonist in her own.

The sacred contract was her hero's journey as much as mine.

## To the Nancys

There are other Nancys.

Wives married to men who are lost. Husbands married to women who are drowning. Partners who love someone through darkness with no guarantee of dawn.

To you, Nancy would say:

*If you have received a word to stay—stay. The assignment is real. The awakening is possible.*

*If you have not received that word—seek it. Ask directly: Is this my assignment? Am I called to stay? Listen for the answer.*

*Not everyone is called to stay. Some situations require leaving for safety, for sanity, for survival. Do not wear someone else's assignment.*

*But if you are called to stay—stay with intention, with boundaries, with your own support system, with faith that transcends circumstances.*

*Your staying may be the love that awakens your spouse.*

*Your faithfulness may be the grace that breaks through.*

*Your sacred contract may be waiting for completion.*

## The Marriage Now

Let me tell you about our marriage now.

Not perfect. Not without challenges. Not a fairy tale ending where everything is easy.

But real.

We see each other now—actually see. The masks are gone. The performances have ended. What remains is two people who have walked through hell together and emerged holding hands.

We like each other now—genuinely like. The resentments have been processed. The wounds have been healed enough that we can enjoy each other's company, laugh together, be friends as well as spouses.

We trust each other now—trust rebuilt through consistent evidence over time. I earned back trust through thousands of small choices. Nancy extended trust through thousands of small risks.

We serve together now—partners in mission, not just partners in life. The alignment of purpose has given the marriage a meaning beyond itself.

This is what the sacred contract produced.

This is what those years of darkness were building toward.

This is the marriage that will serve as testimony for thousands of couples who think their marriage cannot be saved.

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you are the one being loved into awakening—receive it. Recognize the sacred gift of someone who will not give up on you. Honor that gift by doing the work of transformation.*

*If you are the one doing the loving—know that your faithfulness matters more than you can see. The seeds you plant in darkness will bloom in light.*

*If you are the couple on the other side—the ones who have made it through—know that your marriage is now ministry. What you have survived has become qualification. What you have built together has become hope for others.*

*Sacred contracts are completed when we become what we were contracted to produce.*

*Nancy completed hers.*

*I am completing mine.*

*What contract is being completed through you?*
