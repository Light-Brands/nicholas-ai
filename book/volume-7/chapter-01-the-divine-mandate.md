# Chapter One
## The Divine Mandate

---

*"The Call to Help Couples and Leaders"*

---

I did not seek this calling.

It found me.

In the darkness. In the destruction. In the very places I thought disqualified me from being used by God.

This chapter is about the divine mandate that emerged from my transformation—the call to serve others who walk where I once walked.

---

## How the Mandate Arrived

The mandate did not come as a booming voice from heaven.

It came as a steady knowing.

Through the ibogaine experience, through the integration period, through the daily practice of living from revealed identity—a conviction grew stronger and stronger:

*This journey was not just for me.*

Every wound I suffered, every covenant I made, every dark night I barely survived—all of it was preparation. All of it was curriculum. All of it was the unique qualification for a specific assignment.

I was being equipped to help others.

Not everyone. Not in general ways.

Specific people with specific problems.

---

## The Specific Calling

The mandate became precise:

**Primary Target:** Entrepreneurial married couples with children who are dealing with:
- Infidelity
- Addictions
- Mental health challenges
- Burnout
- Physical health challenges

**Secondary Target:** Leaders who are:
- Successful on the outside, dying on the inside
- Achieved everything and woke to emptiness
- Recovered but not healed
- Strong publicly, crumbling privately

**Tertiary Target:** The lost travelers—anyone who:
- Has forgotten they belong in the garden
- Is wandering in darkness
- Needs guidance home to Papa

---

## Why These Targets?

These targets are not random. They are precisely matched to my experience.

**Entrepreneurial married couples** — I have built multiple businesses. I have nearly destroyed a marriage. I understand the unique pressures that entrepreneurship places on relationships. I know how success can mask dysfunction. I know how the drive that builds companies can burn down families.

**Dealing with infidelity, addiction, mental health** — I have lived all of these. Not as an observer but as a participant. I know the shame. I know the secrecy. I know the desperate hope and the crushing relapse. I know what it's like to be hospitalized. I know what it's like to hear whispers of suicide while presenting as successful.

**Leaders dying inside** — I was one. VP title. Seven-figure potential. Magazine covers and speaking engagements. And underneath: terror, emptiness, addiction, the performance of wholeness while falling apart.

The wounds become doors.

The very things that seemed to disqualify me are precisely what qualify me.

## The Authority of Experience

There are two kinds of teachers.

The first teaches from information. They have studied the subject. They can explain concepts, cite research, present frameworks. This teaching is valuable.

The second teaches from transformation. They have lived the subject. Their body bears the scars. Their soul has walked through fire. This teaching is different—it carries an authority that information alone cannot provide.

I teach from transformation.

When I speak to an entrepreneur whose marriage is crumbling, I am not observing from outside. I have been there. I have felt the terror of watching everything I built start to fall. I have known the shame of being the problem while pretending to be the solution.

When I speak to someone struggling with addiction, I am not speaking theoretically. I have felt the craving. I have experienced the relapse. I have known the despair of "Why can't I stop?"

When I speak to someone with suicidal ideation, I am not guessing at what they feel. I have heard those same whispers. I have known that same dark logic.

This experience is not something I would have chosen.

But it is the foundation of my mandate.

## The Shape of the Ministry

What does this mandate look like in practice?

**Direct Work with Couples and Leaders:**
- Intensive transformation experiences
- Guided sacred medicine journeys (for those called to that path)
- Integration support and ongoing coaching
- Community building among those in similar journeys

**Training and Deployment:**
- Equipping others who have been transformed to help others
- Building a network of wounded healers
- Creating resources and frameworks for transformation

**Systemic Change:**
- Advocating for access to sacred medicine and alternative healing approaches
- Speaking and writing to shift cultural understanding of healing
- Building epicenters that model transformed living

**Generational Impact:**
- Breaking cycles of dysfunction in families
- Creating legacy of healing that extends five generations forward
- Demonstrating that the sins of the fathers do not have to be passed down

## The Source of the Mandate

Let me be clear about where this mandate comes from.

It does not come from my ambition.

After decades of striving, proving, and achieving, I have no desire to build another empire for my own glory. That fuel has been burned out. The covenant "Just watch me" has been replaced with surrender.

The mandate comes from God.

It is obedience, not ambition.

I am not building Nicholas's kingdom. I am advancing God's kingdom in a specific territory He has assigned me.

The territory is the territory of the wounded achiever—the person who has everything the world values and wakes to emptiness. The person who is recovered but not healed. The person whose success masks a desperate struggle.

This is my assignment.

This is where I have been sent.

## The Cost of the Mandate

Following a divine mandate is not glamorous.

It requires:

**Vulnerability.** I must share my story—the ugly parts, the shameful parts, the parts I would prefer to hide. My wounds become doors only if I leave them open.

**Sacrifice.** The mandate will require time, energy, resources. It will require saying no to opportunities that don't align. It will require living less for myself and more for others.

**Faith.** I cannot see the full path. I know the destination but not every step. Walking a mandate requires trusting God even when the way forward is unclear.

**Endurance.** Transformation work is not quick. People do not change overnight. The mandate will require long obedience in the same direction.

I accept these costs.

They are worth it.

Because every person who finds their way home to the garden through my service is a soul rescued from the darkness I once knew.

*Dear Traveler,*

*You have a mandate too.*

*It may not look like mine. Your wounds are different, your gifts are different, your assignment is different.*

*But there is a mandate.*

*Somewhere, there are people who need exactly what you have learned. Somewhere, there are lost travelers who would be guided home by exactly your experience. Somewhere, your wounds are waiting to become doors.*

*Ask God: What is my mandate? Who have you prepared me to serve?*

*Listen for the steady knowing.*

*The mandate is not always dramatic. It doesn't always look like global ministry.*

*But it is always specific. And it always flows from the unique intersection of your wounds, your healing, and God's assignment.*

*You were not healed just for you.*

*You were healed to become healing for others.*

*What is your mandate?*
