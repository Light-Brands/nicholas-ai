*"Discerning Your Calling, Building Your Epicenter"*

---

You have traveled through seven volumes of one man's transformation.

Now the question becomes: What is yours?

This final integration chapter is not about Nicholas. It is about you. Your wounds. Your healing. Your mandate. Your epicenter.

The journey you've witnessed was never meant to remain his story.

It was meant to catalyze yours.

---

## The Central Questions

Before any exercises, sit with these questions. Not to answer immediately, but to let them work in you:

*What is the transformation I have received that I am now called to become for others?*

*Where are the people who need exactly what I have learned?*

*What would it look like to build a life around this calling?*

These questions may take months or years to fully answer. But asking them begins the process.

## Final Words

You have completed this book series.

But nothing is complete.

The transformation continues.

The calling unfolds.

The epicenter expands.

You are not the same person who began reading Volume One. Something has shifted. Something has awakened. Something has been commissioned.

Honor that shift.

Act on that awakening.

Live into that commission.

The world does not need more people who have read about transformation.

The world needs people who are becoming transformation.

The world needs you.

*Dear Traveler,*

*The journey that began in these pages continues in your life.*

*Nicholas's story is told. Now you must live yours.*

*The wounds you have received are becoming doors.*

*The darkness you have walked through is becoming light for others.*

*You are part of this expansion now.*

*Go.*

*Build your epicenter.*

*Serve your people.*

*Live your calling.*

*The garden awaits.*
