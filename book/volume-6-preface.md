# Preface to Volume VI: The Identity Reclaimed
## Declarations of the Transformed Self

---

Dear Traveler,

You must speak who you are before you can live who you are.

I spent forty-five years being told who I was by voices that did not have the authority to define me. The voice of my abuser that whispered I was an object to be used. The voice of the world that measured my worth by my achievements. The voice of the recovery industry that labeled me a recovering addict. The voice of my own wounded soul that repeated the covenants I had never consciously made.

All of these voices were lying.

This volume is about reclaiming the truth of your identity—not the identity given to you by trauma, not the identity you performed for applause, not the identity that kept you safe but kept you small. The true identity. The eternal identity. The identity spoken over you before the foundation of the world.

I am not a human being searching for God.

I am an eternal spirit, temporarily animated by God, living a human experience in the seen realm.

Read that again. Let it sink past your intellect into your bones. Because everything changes when you understand who you actually are.

The journey of identity moves through three stages. First, there is the Old Identity—the performer, the addict, the failure, the wounded one, the one who believed the covenants, the one who built towers on sand. This identity feels true because it has governed you for so long. But it was never true. It was only familiar.

Then there is the Transitional Identity—the survivor, the recovered, the one in process, the one doing the work. This identity is better than the old, but it is still defined by the wound. Still oriented around what happened to you rather than who you actually are.

And finally, there is the Revealed Identity—the Son of I Am. The King in the Kingdom. The Ambassador of Heaven on Earth. The Apostle of Awakening. The Wounded Healer who no longer hides his scars but offers them as doors for others.

This is who I am. This is who I have always been. The trauma obscured it. The performance buried it. The covenants denied it. But it was never destroyed—because it cannot be destroyed. The image of God pressed into the fabric of my being is eternal.

The same is true for you.

In this volume, I share the declarations I speak over my life daily. Not affirmations—I have learned to distrust that word, because it often implies we are trying to convince ourselves of something we don't believe. These are declarations—statements of what is already true, spoken in faith until our experience catches up with reality.

I am totally dead to myself and reborn as a son of God.

I am love, peace, joy, happiness, freedom, abundance, prosperity, and victory.

My pursuit is to live every moment in oneness, in intimate union and communion with Christ in the garden of my heart and soul.

These are not wishes. They are facts. They are the truth of my eternal identity spoken into the realm of time until time conforms to eternity.

You will find templates in this volume for crafting your own declarations. Frameworks for identifying the false identities you have carried. Practices for replacing the old covenants with new ones—covenants of life instead of death, freedom instead of bondage, love that is safe instead of love that equals suffering.

The garden has always been your true home. And you have always been worthy of belonging there.

It is time to speak it. To declare it. To reclaim what was stolen.

You are not who they said you were.

You are who God says you are.

With love and royal authority,
