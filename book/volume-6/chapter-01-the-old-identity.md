# Chapter One
## The Old Identity

---

*"Drug Dealer, Performer, Addict, Failure"*

---

For forty-five years, I wore identities that didn't belong to me.

I didn't know they were costumes. I thought they were my skin. I believed them so completely that the idea of being someone else—someone fundamentally different—seemed impossible.

These identities were not chosen consciously. They were assigned by trauma, reinforced by performance, and confirmed by the world's validation. They became the operating system of my life.

They were all lies.

## The Identities I Wore

**The Wounded One**

This was the first false identity. Written at age eight, in a basement, by hands that had no right to touch me.

"You are an object. Your body is not your own. You exist to be used."

I didn't have words for this identity at the time. But it lived in my nervous system. It shaped how I related to my own body, to intimacy, to trust.

**The Abandoned One**

Written at age fifteen, when first love shattered. Reinforced when I felt judged and rejected by my father's ultimatum.

"You are not worth staying for. People you love will leave. You will always be alone."

This identity made me build walls. If abandonment was inevitable, I would control the terms. I would leave before being left. I would perform closeness while maintaining distance.

**The Performer**

Written through years of survival.

"Your worth is in what you produce. If you stop achieving, you stop mattering. The only valuable you is the successful you."

This identity drove the empire-building, the corporate ascent, the relentless striving. It made me excellent at performing wellness while being deeply sick inside.

**The Addict**

Written by substance and reinforced by the recovery industry.

"You are fundamentally broken. You will always be in recovery. You are one drink away from destruction."

This identity kept me focused on the problem instead of the solution. It defined me by my disease rather than my design.

**The Failure**

Written by the collapse.

"You had everything and you lost it. You are proof that some people can't be trusted with success. You are the cautionary tale."

This identity emerged when the career ended, when the money disappeared, when the towers I had built came crashing down.

## How Identity Forms

These identities didn't arrive as beliefs. They arrived as *experiences*.

When you are violated as a child, your body learns something about its value before your mind has words. The identity writes itself in the nervous system.

When you are heartbroken as a teenager, the pain becomes a teacher. "This is what love does. This is who you are in relation to love."

When you achieve and are praised, you learn that value comes from doing. The performing identity strengthens with every accomplishment.

When you relapse, when you are hospitalized, when you fail publicly—each event confirms the identity of brokenness.

We do not choose our early identities. They choose us.

But we can learn to choose differently.

## The Power of Identity

Identity is not just how you see yourself.

Identity is the filter through which all experience passes.

When you carry the identity of "The Wounded One," you interpret touch as potential threat, intimacy as danger, vulnerability as foolishness.

When you carry the identity of "The Performer," you interpret rest as laziness, worth as contingent, and love as conditional on output.

When you carry the identity of "The Addict," you interpret sobriety as temporary, recovery as fragile, and yourself as fundamentally diseased.

The identities we carry shape what we notice, what we remember, what we believe, and how we act.

Change the identity, change everything.

## Why False Identity Persists

These identities persist because they *work*.

Not in the sense of producing health and wholeness. In the sense of producing survival.

The Performer identity drove my success. It made me wealthy by twenty-one. It built businesses and careers. From the outside, it looked like a winning strategy.

The Wounded One identity kept me alert to danger. It prevented certain kinds of hurt by ensuring I never fully trusted, never fully opened.

The Addict identity gave me community. The recovery rooms were full of people who shared this identity. There was belonging in the label.

We don't hold onto identities that don't serve us in some way.

But what serves survival often sabotages thriving.

The very identities that kept me alive were killing my soul.

## The Cost of False Identity

Let me count what these identities cost me:

**Intimacy with Nancy.** She wanted to connect with the real me. The Performer showed up instead. For seventeen years, she was married to a mask.

**Presence with my children.** They needed a father who was there, not a father performing presence while internally managing anxiety and maintaining walls.

**Peace of mind.** The Performer never rests. The Wounded One is always vigilant. The Addict is always afraid. These identities produce chronic stress, not peace.

**Authentic spirituality.** How can you know God when you don't know yourself? The false identities blocked the deeper encounter my soul craved.

**Health.** The stress of performance, the weight of hiding, the toll of constant vigilance—all manifested in my body as insomnia, anxiety, depression.

The identities that promised safety delivered prison.

## The Threshold

The work of transformation reaches a crucial threshold:

You must stop being who you were told to be.

Not by force of will. That just creates more performance—"I'm trying really hard to be different."

By revelation.

When you actually see that the identities were costumes, that they were responses to wounds, that they were survival strategies that are no longer needed—something shifts.

You don't have to keep wearing them.

You can take them off.

Not all at once. Not without grief for the years lost to false identity. Not without fear of who you might be without them.

But the threshold can be crossed.

The old identity can die.

And something new can be born.

*Dear Traveler,*

*What identities have you been wearing?*

*Not the ones you chose consciously—the ones that were assigned by trauma, by the world, by the labels given to you.*

*Take an inventory.*

*What does your wound tell you about who you are?*

*What does your achievement tell you?*

*What does your failure tell you?*

*What does your diagnosis tell you?*

*These identities feel true because they're familiar. But familiar is not the same as true.*

*You are not the sum of what happened to you.*

*You are not your trauma.*

*You are not your success.*

*You are not your failure.*

*You are not your disease.*

*There is a truer identity waiting.*

*But first, you must see—really see—the false ones you've been wearing.*
