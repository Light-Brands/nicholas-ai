# Chapter Seven
## The Eternal Perspective

---

*"I Am an Eternal Spirit Living a Human Experience"*

---

This is the most important sentence I have ever understood:

I am not a human being searching for God.

I am an eternal spirit, temporarily animated by God, living a human experience in the seen realm.

Read it again. Let it sink past your intellect.

Everything changes when you understand this.

---

## The Conventional View

Most of us live with an unconscious assumption:

*I am fundamentally a physical being who may or may not have a spiritual dimension.*

We think of ourselves as bodies that contain something called a soul or spirit. The physical is primary. The spiritual is secondary—an add-on, an enhancement, a religious concern.

This view shapes everything:

- Death becomes the end of existence (or at least its most important part)
- Physical comfort becomes the highest value
- Spiritual practices become optional extras
- Identity is defined by what the body experiences and the world reflects

This was my operating assumption for forty-five years.

It was wrong.

## The Revealed View

The sacred encounters—particularly Bufo, but also the throne room experience in ibogaine—revealed a different reality:

*I am fundamentally an eternal spirit who is temporarily experiencing physical existence.*

The spirit is primary. The body is secondary—a temporary vehicle, an instrument for earthly operation, a tent I am camping in.

This shift is not semantic. It is ontological. It is a completely different understanding of what I actually am.

**In this view:**

- Death is a transition, not an ending
- Spiritual reality is the foundation, physical reality is the surface
- My truest self exists beyond time
- Identity is rooted in the eternal, not the temporal

---

## The Evidence

I did not arrive at this view through philosophical reasoning.

I arrived through experience.

In the Bufo ceremony, the boundary between self and God dissolved. I experienced—not just believed, but experienced—the eternal nature of consciousness. Time collapsed. Individuality dissolved. What remained was infinite, timeless, unified being.

I know this sounds abstract. It's not.

It was the most concrete experience of my life.

I have tasted eternity.

I have been outside of time.

I know—not believe, know—that the deepest level of my being is not bound by this body, this lifetime, this moment in history.

I am an eternal spirit.

The human experience is real and important. But it is not the foundation.

## Living from Eternal Perspective

How does this change daily life?

**Time loses its tyranny.**

When you know you are eternal, the desperate urgency around earthly time fades. You still steward your time well—but you stop living as if this life is all there is.

**Fear of death diminishes.**

When you have experienced yourself as essentially spirit, death of the body becomes a transition rather than termination. This does not make life less precious—it makes it more so, because you see it as the gift it is.

**Circumstances lose their defining power.**

When your identity is rooted in the eternal, temporary circumstances cannot define you. Success, failure, health, sickness—these all matter, but they don't determine who you are.

**Priorities clarify.**

What matters eternally becomes more important than what matters temporarily. Relationships over achievements. Character over accomplishments. Love over stuff.

**Peace becomes accessible.**

When you know that the deepest part of you is safe in God, untouchable by circumstance, united with the eternal—peace is available regardless of what's happening in the temporal.

## The Spirit's Relationship to Time

Here is what I now understand about the Trinitarian self and time:

**My body experiences time.**

The Dark Warrior—my physical form—is bound by time. It was born, it will die. It ages, it changes. It experiences moment after moment in sequence.

**My soul interprets time.**

The Light Warrior—mind, will, emotions—processes time. It remembers the past, anticipates the future, makes sense of the present. It creates narrative from the sequence of moments.

**My spirit transcends time.**

The Creator—my spirit, united with the Holy Spirit—exists beyond time. It has access to eternal perspective. It touches a realm where past, present, and future are all equally accessible.

This is why prayer can work. This is why the throne room was timeless. This is why healing can happen in an instant that "takes" decades to manifest.

The spirit operates beyond the constraints that bind body and soul.

## The Practical Application

This is not esoteric philosophy. It is practical guidance.

**When anxiety grips:**

I remember that my eternal self is safe. The spirit that I truly am is held in God, beyond the reach of circumstance. The anxiety is a body-soul experience. It is not the whole truth.

**When grief overwhelms:**

I remember that relationships continue beyond this life. That those who have died are not ended, merely transitioned. That reunion is real.

**When circumstances collapse:**

I remember that this moment is temporary. That the eternal is untouched. That what seems like ending is often just transition.

**When the world feels meaningless:**

I remember that I am participating in something eternal. That what I do in the body matters to the spirit. That love never dies.

The eternal perspective does not make me dismissive of earthly life. It makes me more present to it—because I see it as the precious, temporary, significant gift it is.

## The Garden Is Now

One more implication of the eternal perspective:

The garden is not somewhere else.

The garden is not someday.

The garden is here. Now.

In the eternal now where my spirit dwells with God, I am already home. Already in the garden. Already in union with the divine.

The veil between seen and unseen is thin.

I can access the garden—not by dying, not by waiting—by presence.

Every time I enter presence—every time I step out of time-traveling anxiety and into the eternal now—I am in the garden.

This is the gift of the eternal perspective: heaven is not just future. It is present, accessible, real.

The kingdom of God is within you.

Now.

Always now.

*Dear Traveler,*

*You are more than you have been told.*

*You are not fundamentally a body that might have a spirit.*

*You are fundamentally a spirit that temporarily has a body.*

*Let this sink in.*

*Your truest self is eternal.*

*What happens in time matters—deeply—but it does not define the core of who you are.*

*You are held by the Eternal.*

*You are made for the Eternal.*

*You are, at your deepest level, participating in the Eternal—right now, in this moment, as you read these words.*

*The garden is not far.*

*The garden is not later.*

*The garden is here.*

*Present.*

*Accessible.*

*Yours.*
