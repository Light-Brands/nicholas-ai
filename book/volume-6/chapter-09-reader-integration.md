Volume VI has presented the journey from false identity through transitional identity to revealed identity. This Reader Integration section provides practical tools for claiming and living your true identity.

## Part One: Identity Inventory

### Exercise 1: The Old Identity Map

Before you can release false identities, you must see them clearly.

**Complete this inventory:**

**Childhood Messages:**
What did you learn about who you are from ages 0-12?
- From parents:
- From siblings:
- From school:
- From abuse/trauma (if applicable):
- From religious training:

**Adolescent Messages:**
What did you learn about who you are from ages 13-18?
- From peers:
- From romantic relationships:
- From achievements/failures:
- From your body:

**Adult Messages:**
What have you learned about who you are as an adult?
- From career:
- From marriage/relationships:
- From children:
- From failures:
- From diagnoses:

**Review:** Which of these messages formed false identities you still carry?

---

### Exercise 2: Naming Your False Identities

Give names to the false identities you've worn:

Nicholas identified:
- The Wounded One
- The Abandoned One
- The Performer
- The Addict
- The Failure

**Your false identities:**

1. Name: ___________________
   - Source (when/how formed):
   - Core lie it carries:
   - How it has protected you:
   - What it has cost you:

2. Name: ___________________
   - Source:
   - Core lie:
   - Protection:
   - Cost:

3. Name: ___________________
   - Source:
   - Core lie:
   - Protection:
   - Cost:

### Exercise 3: Transitional Identity Assessment

Are you in transitional identity? Evaluate:

| Statement | Not at all (1) | Somewhat (3) | Definitely (5) |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| I define myself primarily by what happened to me | | | |
| My value comes from surviving/overcoming | | | |
| My story/testimony is central to my identity | | | |
| I am "in recovery" or "working on" myself | | | |
| I still need the label (survivor, recovered, rebuilder) | | | |

**Score 5-10:** Still solidly in old identity—transitional work needed first
**Score 11-18:** In transitional identity—valuable stage, honor it
**Score 19-25:** May be ready to move toward revealed identity

---

## Part Two: Discovering Revealed Identity

### Exercise 4: What Does God Say?

Your revealed identity comes from God's declaration, not your experience.

**Scripture Study:**

Read each passage. Write what it says about your identity:

*John 1:12* — I am:

*Ephesians 2:6* — I am:

*2 Corinthians 5:20* — I am:

*1 Peter 2:9* — I am:

*Galatians 4:7* — I am:

*Colossians 3:3* — I am:

**Synthesis:** Based on these passages, who does God say you are?

### Exercise 5: The Revealed Identity Profile

Create your identity profile:

**Core Identity:** (Son/Daughter of I Am + one phrase)

Example: "I am a son of I Am, royal, redeemed, and restored."

Your version: "I am _________________________________"

**Kingdom Role:** (Ambassador, King/Queen, Apostle, Prophet, etc.)

Example: "I am an ambassador of Heaven's Kingdom on Earth."

Your version: "I am _________________________________"

**Specific Calling:** (What you are sent to do)

Example: "I am an apostle in the marketplace, bringing healing to broken leaders."

Your version: "I am _________________________________"

**Character Declaration:** (Who you are in relationships)

Example: "I am the most loving husband and present father."

Your version: "I am _________________________________"

## Closing Practice

### Exercise 15: The Identity Meditation

   Exhale: Let it go.

3. Speak your core identity declaration internally.
   "I am a son/daughter of I Am."

4. Visualize: See yourself as God sees you. Not the wounded version. Not the performing version. The eternal version.

5. Receive: Let the truth of who you are wash over you.

6. Speak: Open your eyes. Speak your war cry out loud.

7. Return: Go into your day carrying this identity.
