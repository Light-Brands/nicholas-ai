# Chapter Three
## The Revealed Identity

---

*"Son of I Am, King, Ambassador, Apostle, Healer"*

---

I am not a human being searching for God.

I am an eternal spirit, temporarily animated by God, living a human experience in the seen realm.

This is my revealed identity.

And it changes everything.

## What Was Revealed

During the sacred encounters—the ibogaine, the Bufo, the boosters—something was not just healed. Something was revealed.

Underneath all the false identities, underneath the trauma and the performance and the survival strategies, there was a self I had never fully met.

An eternal self.

A self that existed before the abuse, before the heartbreak, before the departure from home.

A self that existed before I was born.

A self that will exist after this body returns to dust.

This is the revealed identity. Not something I constructed. Not something I earned. Something that was there all along, hidden beneath layers of falsehood, waiting to be uncovered.

## The Components of Revealed Identity

**Son of I Am.**

This is the foundational truth. I am not an orphan. I am not abandoned. I am not alone.

I am a son.

A son of the God who introduced Himself to Moses as "I Am." A son whose identity derives not from earthly fathers—flawed, limited, absent—but from the eternal Father who is perfect in love.

"I am a son of I Am."

This is who I have always been. This is who I will always be.

**King.**

Not arrogance. Royal identity.

I am a king in the Kingdom of God. Not a peasant waiting for approval. Not a slave hoping for freedom. A king—seated in authority, ruling from my position, operating from power rather than begging for it.

This is not self-made royalty. This is delegated authority. The King of Kings has made me a king in His kingdom.

**Ambassador.**

I am not a citizen of this world who hopes someday to visit heaven. I am a citizen of heaven, temporarily stationed on earth.

An ambassador carries the authority of the government that sent them. An ambassador represents the King in foreign territory. An ambassador speaks and acts on behalf of a higher power.

This is my role on earth. To represent heaven. To carry Kingdom authority into earthly situations. To be the presence of God in rooms that have forgotten Him.

**Apostle.**

This word means "sent one."

I am not wandering. I am sent.

Not sent to a church building. Sent to the marketplace. Sent to the boardroom. Sent to the places where entrepreneurial couples are struggling, where leaders are burning out, where success is empty and addiction is winning.

I am an apostle in the marketplace—carrying Kingdom authority into the places traditional religion has abandoned.

**Healer.**

My wounds have been transformed.

What was once a source of shame is now a source of ministry. What was hidden is now offered. What was weakness is now strength.

I am a wounded healer—not despite my pain but because of it. The very things that nearly destroyed me have become the keys to helping others find freedom.

## The Shift in Orientation

The revealed identity represents a fundamental shift in orientation.

**From outside-in to inside-out.**

The old identities came from outside. They were assigned by events, by others, by the world. They shaped me from the outside in.

The revealed identity comes from inside. It flows from the eternal self, from the spirit united with God, from the deepest truth of who I am. It shapes me from the inside out.

**From doing to being.**

The old identities were about doing. The Performer was valuable because of what he produced. The Addict was defined by what he used. The Failure was judged by what he lost.

The revealed identity is about being. I am successful in my being before ever doing. I have worth before I accomplish anything.

**From earning to receiving.**

The old identities required constant earning. Every day, I had to prove my worth through achievement, performance, or survival.

The revealed identity is received. I did not earn my sonship. I did not earn my royalty. I did not earn my ambassadorship. These were given—by the God who defines reality, whose declaration is more true than any earthly assessment.

## Living From Revealed Identity

How does revealed identity change daily life?

**When I wake up,** I am already valuable. I don't have to prove anything today. My identity is secure in my Father.

**When I face challenges,** I operate from royal authority. I am not a victim hoping for rescue. I am a king addressing situations from my throne.

**When I interact with others,** I am an ambassador. I carry something from heaven into every room. I represent a kingdom that cannot be shaken.

**When I encounter suffering,** I am a healer. My wounds have been transformed into doors. What I once hid I now offer.

**When I make decisions,** I ask: Does this align with who I actually am? Does this fit my revealed identity as son, king, ambassador, apostle, healer?

The revealed identity becomes the filter through which all of life passes.

## The Biblical Foundation

This is not new-age self-help. This is biblical anthropology.

*"Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God."* — John 1:12

*"And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms."* — Ephesians 2:6

*"We are therefore Christ's ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us."* — 2 Corinthians 5:20

*"You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's special possession."* — 1 Peter 2:9

The revealed identity is not Nicholas's invention. It is Scripture's declaration about who we actually are in Christ.

## The Resistance

The revealed identity will be resisted.

The enemy wants you in false identity. The world rewards false identity. Your own flesh is comfortable in false identity.

When you start declaring "I am a son of I Am," something inside will say: *Who do you think you are?*

When you start operating as a king, something will whisper: *You're getting too big for your britches.*

When you start calling yourself an ambassador, the religious spirit will accuse: *That's arrogant. That's presumptuous.*

Expect resistance. Do not be surprised by it.

The revealed identity must be spoken and lived *in defiance* of the voices that want to keep you small, wounded, and manageable.

*Dear Traveler,*

*Who are you?*

*Not who did trauma say you are. Not who did the world say you are. Not who did your failures say you are.*

*Who did God say you are?*

*You are a son or daughter of the Most High.*

*You are royalty—seated in heavenly places.*

*You are sent—an ambassador with Kingdom authority.*

*You are gifted—carrying something the world needs.*

*This is not arrogance. This is alignment with reality.*

*The question is not whether you deserve this identity. (You don't—none of us do.)*

*The question is whether you will receive it.*

*Receive it.*

*Speak it.*

*Live it.*

*The revealed identity is waiting to be claimed.*
