## The Covenants Replaced

---

*"Old Vows Replaced with New Truths"*

---

The three covenants that governed my life were burned before the throne of God.

But fire that destroys must be followed by something that builds.

The old covenants were not just removed. They were *replaced*.

---

## The Nature of Covenant

A covenant is more than a belief. It is a binding agreement.

The old covenants were made in moments of overwhelming pain. They were not conscious choices—they were survival mechanisms that calcified into invisible contracts.

"Love equals suffering."

"I am my own god."

"Just watch me."

These covenants had the power of agreement behind them. Somewhere in my soul, I had said *yes* to these propositions. And that yes—however unconscious—carried binding force.

The burning of the covenants was a formal *renunciation*. A cancellation of the agreement. A divine annulment of contracts that were never meant to be made.

But covenants cannot simply be removed. They must be replaced.

The soul that made those agreements still exists. The capacity for covenant remains. If the old covenants are burned but nothing takes their place, new false covenants will form.

Nature abhors a vacuum.

So does the soul.

## The Three Replacements

For each old covenant, a new truth was installed:

**Old Covenant 1: Love Equals Suffering**

This covenant was made at age eight, in the basement, when intimacy became violation. It was reinforced at age fifteen when love led to heartbreak.

*The lie: If you let yourself love, you will suffer. Intimacy is dangerous. Protection is necessary.*

**New Covenant 1: Love Is Safe**

*The truth: God is love. Perfect love casts out fear. Love in its true form heals rather than wounds.*

The new covenant doesn't deny that twisted love can hurt. It acknowledges that what I experienced was not true love—it was violation, betrayal, brokenness.

True love—love that flows from God, love that reflects divine nature—is safe. It heals. It nourishes. It does not violate.

I can now open my heart because I know the difference between true love and counterfeit.

**Declaration:** *I receive divine love that heals, not wounds. I am safe in love. Intimacy is a gift, not a threat.*

---

**Old Covenant 2: I Am My Own God**

This covenant was made at age fifteen when trust collapsed. If God couldn't be trusted, if no one could be relied on, the only option was self-sovereignty.

*The lie: You cannot trust God. You cannot trust anyone. Crown yourself. Need no one.*

**New Covenant 2: Christ Is Lord**

*The truth: Jesus Christ is Lord of my life. I surrender the throne. I yield the crown.*

The new covenant doesn't deny that I was wounded by those who should have protected me. It doesn't pretend that trust was never broken.

But it recognizes that self-sovereignty was never the answer. I was never qualified to be my own god. Every attempt at controlling my own destiny led to destruction.

Christ is Lord. Not me. His throne, not mine. His plans, not mine.

And in this surrender, I find the security that self-sovereignty could never provide.

**Declaration:** *I renounce the throne I built for myself. Jesus Christ is Lord. I surrender control and receive His governance.*

---

**Old Covenant 3: Just Watch Me**

This covenant was made at age sixteen, at the door of my childhood home, fueled by wounded pride and the need to prove worth through achievement.

*The lie: Your value is in what you produce. Achievement is validation. Just watch me prove I matter.*

**New Covenant 3: I Am Enough**

*The truth: I am valuable because of whose I am, not what I do. Identity precedes activity. Being before doing.*

The new covenant doesn't deny that I have gifts, abilities, and callings. It doesn't make achievement sinful or ambition wrong.

But it divorces achievement from identity. I no longer need to prove my worth. I no longer need anyone to "watch" while I demonstrate my value.

I am a son of I Am. That is enough. That has always been enough.

Anything I accomplish flows from this identity rather than trying to earn it.

**Declaration:** *I receive Kingdom identity—not through doing, but through being. I am enough. I no longer prove; I simply am.*

---

## Living the New Covenants

The replacement covenants are not one-time declarations. They must be lived daily.

**When fear of intimacy arises:**

I notice it. I acknowledge it. And then I speak: *Love is safe. This fear comes from old wounding, not present reality. I choose to open rather than protect.*

**When the temptation to control arises:**

I notice it. I acknowledge it. And then I speak: *Christ is Lord. I don't have to figure this out myself. I surrender to His governance.*

**When the drive to prove myself arises:**

I notice it. I acknowledge it. And then I speak: *I am enough. I don't have to achieve this to matter. My identity is secure in my Father.*

The new covenants become the new operating system.

Not instantly. The old pathways are worn deep. But over time, as the new covenants are spoken and lived, they become the default.

## The Covenant of Marriage

Beyond the three individual covenants, a marriage covenant was also renewed.

The marriage between Nancy and me had been governed by my false covenants. She was trying to love a man who believed love equals suffering. She was trying to connect with a man who trusted no one. She was trying to reach a man who was always performing, always proving.

When my covenants were replaced, the marriage began to transform.

Now we operate under a different covenant:

**The Trinity of Marriage**

Jesus + Nancy + Nicholas

A threefold cord that cannot be easily broken.

Our covenant is no longer two broken people trying to make each other whole. It is two healed people in union with Christ, overflow from fullness rather than grasping from emptiness.

**Declaration:** *Our marriage is a trinity—Jesus, Nancy, Nicholas—operating in oneness, union, and reconciliation. We produce divine health, abundance, and eternal expansion together.*

## Your Covenant Inventory

What covenants have you made?

Not consciously—few of our binding agreements are conscious.

**Look for patterns:**

- Repeated relationship failures may indicate an intimacy covenant
- Chronic control issues may indicate a trust/sovereignty covenant
- Compulsive achievement may indicate a worth/proving covenant

**Ask:**

- What did I learn to believe about love through my early experiences?
- What did I learn to believe about trust and authority?
- What did I learn to believe about my value and how it is determined?

The answers may reveal covenants that need to be burned and replaced.

*Dear Traveler,*

*What covenants govern your life?*

*What agreements—never consciously made—shape every relationship, every decision, every moment?*

*These covenants can be changed.*

*Not by willpower. Not by trying harder. But by renunciation and replacement.*

*Bring your covenants before God's throne.*

*Renounce them—formally, specifically, out loud.*

*And then receive the new covenants—the truths that replace the lies.*

*Love is safe.*

*Christ is Lord.*

*You are enough.*

*Speak these truths until they become your operating system.*

*The old covenants were burned.*

*The new covenants are waiting to be lived.*
