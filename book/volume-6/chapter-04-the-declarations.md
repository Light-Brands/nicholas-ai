# Chapter Four
## The Declarations

---

*"Speaking Truth Over Your Life Daily"*

---

You must speak who you are before you can live who you are.

This is not positive thinking. This is not affirmation culture. This is not self-help visualization.

This is the spiritual principle of declaration.

---

## Why Declaration Matters

Words create reality.

This is not metaphysics. It is the fabric of Scripture.

"In the beginning was the Word... Through him all things were made." — John 1:1, 3

"God said, 'Let there be light,' and there was light." — Genesis 1:3

"Death and life are in the power of the tongue." — Proverbs 18:21

God spoke the universe into existence. And we, made in His image, have been given the power of speech that shapes reality—our own reality, at minimum.

The words we speak over our lives matter.

They shape our expectations, our beliefs, our actions, and eventually our outcomes.

For forty-five years, I spoke death over my life. Not consciously—but in the constant inner monologue that narrated my existence.

"I am broken. I am an addict. I am unfixable. I am too far gone."

These declarations created a ceiling on my transformation.

Now I speak life.

---

## The Nature of True Declaration

True declaration is not wishful thinking.

It is not saying "I am wealthy" when you are broke, hoping the universe will somehow make it true.

True declaration is speaking what is eternally true, regardless of temporary circumstance.

I am a son of I Am—not because I feel like one, but because God declared it so.

I am royal—not because I've earned it, but because Christ seated me with Him.

I am free—not because freedom is my current experience, but because Jesus said "whom the Son sets free is free indeed."

Declaration is *agreement with God's truth* spoken into the realm of time.

I am speaking what is already true in heaven, calling it forth into manifestation on earth.

"Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." — Matthew 6:10

---

## My Daily Declarations

Every morning, I speak these truths over my life:

**Identity Declarations:**

*I am totally dead to myself and reborn as a son of God, a Citizen of Heaven, and an Ambassador of Heaven's Kingdom on Earth.*

*I have the mind of Christ.*

*I am a child of God—royal, redeemed, and restored.*

*I am freedom walking. I am the Kingdom of God in motion.*

**Character Declarations:**

*I am honor. I am integrity. I am humility in strength.*

*I am a giver—I am generosity.*

*My word is my bond—greater than any signed contract.*

*I listen more than I speak. I hear Heaven and move accordingly.*

**Purpose Declarations:**

*I am an apostle in the marketplace.*

*I am a healer—my wounds become doors for others.*

*I am a reshaper of destinies. I am a transformer of generations.*

*I eradicate the spirit of religion, addiction, divorce, sickness, and poverty globally.*

**Family Declarations:**

*I have the best Queen. I honor her with love, tenderness, truth, and strength.*

*I am the most loving, attentive, and elevating husband on earth.*

*I am the best father—present, powerful, playful, and prophetic.*

*My family is my first ministry—my priority, my joy, my legacy.*

**Spiritual Declarations:**

*The Holy Spirit leads my life, governs my destiny, and ignites my spirit.*

*I begin every day in devotion, renewed and transformed by the Word.*

*I walk in intimacy with my Father.*

*I live mission-first, Kingdom-aligned.*

## The Three Battle Declarations

When challenges arise, I speak these condensed truths:

**Declaration 1:** *I am the son of I AM—Royal, Redeemed, Restored.*

**Declaration 2:** *I am Freedom—Kingdom in Motion, Unstoppable Power.*

**Declaration 3:** *I am Love—Eternal Legacy, Transforming Generations.*

These can be spoken in rhythm with breath:

*On the inhale: I am a Son*
*On the exhale: Royal, Redeemed, Restored*

*On the inhale: I am Freedom*
*On the exhale: Kingdom in Motion, Unstoppable Power*

*On the inhale: I am Love*
*On the exhale: Eternal Legacy, Transforming Generations*

---

## The War Cry

For moments requiring maximum spiritual authority, I speak the fusion of all declarations:

*"I am a Son of God—royal, redeemed, and restored—living in freedom and Kingdom power, I am love in action, I am transforming generations with eternal legacy."*

This is not for show. This is for battle.

When the enemy whispers shame, I declare identity.

When circumstances scream impossibility, I declare Kingdom power.

When the old identities try to reassert themselves, I speak the truth of who I actually am.

---

## How to Practice Declaration

**Morning Practice (5-10 minutes):**

1. Begin with breath prayer, settling into presence
2. Speak your identity declarations out loud
3. Speak your purpose declarations out loud
4. Speak your family declarations out loud
5. Close with the war cry

**Throughout the Day:**

When triggered—when old identities rise, when anxiety grips, when shame whispers—speak the battle declarations.

Not silently. Out loud if possible. The spoken word has power the internal thought lacks.

**Evening Review:**

At end of day, ask: Did I live today in alignment with my declarations?

Not as self-judgment—as recalibration. Tomorrow is a new opportunity to speak and live truth.

---

## Creating Your Own Declarations

The declarations I've shared are mine. They arose from my journey, my encounters, my revealed identity.

Your declarations must be yours.

Here is a framework for creating them:

**1. Start with identity in Christ.**

What does Scripture say about who you are? Write declarations based on eternal truth, not current circumstance.

**2. Add your specific calling.**

What has God revealed about your purpose? What gifts has He given? What battlefield has He assigned?

**3. Include your relationships.**

Declare who you want to be as spouse, parent, friend, leader. Speak it as already true.

**4. Address your specific battlegrounds.**

Where does the enemy attack you most? Create declarations specifically designed to counter those attacks.

**5. Make them speakable.**

Declarations should flow when spoken. They should be memorable enough to speak without reading. Refine until they feel natural.

## The Objections

"Isn't this just self-deception? Saying things that aren't true?"

No. It is speaking eternal truth into temporal experience. The declarations are true in heaven—I am speaking them into manifestation on earth.

"Isn't this arrogant? Calling yourself a king, an apostle?"

Not if God called you those things. Is it arrogant to repeat what your Father has declared over you?

"What if I don't feel it? What if the declarations feel empty?"

Speak them anyway. Feelings follow faith, not the other way around. Speak the truth until your experience catches up with reality.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*What are you speaking over your life?*

*What words fill your internal monologue?*

*What do you say about yourself when no one is listening?*

*These words are shaping your reality.*

*Begin to speak differently.*

*Speak who you are—not who trauma said, not who failure showed, not who the world labeled.*

*Speak the eternal truth of your identity.*

*Speak it every day.*

*Speak it until you believe it.*

*Speak it until you live it.*

*Declaration is not the end of transformation. But without it, transformation remains incomplete.*

*Speak, traveler.*

*Speak who you are.*
