# Chapter Nine
## Freedom

---

*"Freedom. Freedom. Freedom."*

---

I slept.

After the flood dose—after the visions, the throne room, the burning of covenants—my body finally surrendered to exhaustion.

Not the fitful, medicated, shallow sleep I had known for years.

Real sleep.

Deep sleep.

The sleep of someone whose nervous system has finally been told it's safe.

---

## The Waking

When I woke, I didn't know where I was at first.

The room in Cancun. The bed. The soft light filtering through the window.

I was still in the clinic. Still being monitored by the medical team. Still in the aftermath of the most profound experience of my life.

But something was different.

The heaviness was gone.

I had become so accustomed to the weight—the depression that greeted me every morning, the dread of facing another day, the whispers that told me my family would be better off without me.

Gone.

Not suppressed. Not managed. Not temporarily lifted.

*Gone.*

In its place: a word.

A word that kept rising in my consciousness, unbidden, like a spring bubbling up from deep earth.

**Freedom.**

---

## The Word That Kept Coming

**Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.**

I lay in that bed, and the word kept repeating.

Not a thought I was generating. Not an affirmation I was speaking to myself.

It was arising. From somewhere deeper than thought. From the place where the covenants had lived—now empty, now filled with something new.

**Freedom.**

I said it out loud.

"Freedom."

My voice cracked. Tears started again—but different tears than before. Not tears of grief or release. Tears of amazement. Tears of someone who has been pardoned and cannot quite believe it.

"Freedom."

The medical team came in. They had been monitoring me through the night, watching my vitals, ready to intervene if needed.

"How do you feel?" the nurse asked.

I couldn't answer for a moment. The question was too big. How do I feel? How do you describe the absence of chains you've worn so long you forgot they were chains?

"Free," I finally said. "I feel free."

## The Suffering Gone

Let me be specific about what I mean.

The suffering in my soul was completely gone.

Not diminished. Not reduced. Not temporarily eased.

*Completely gone.*

The suicidal ideation that had been my constant companion—gone. Not a whisper. Not a hint. The voice that had told me for months that my family would be better off without me had been silenced.

The depression that had colored my perception of everything—gone. Not lifted, like when medication works. *Gone*, like it had never existed.

The anxiety that had kept my nervous system in constant fight-or-flight—gone. My body felt calm in a way it had never felt. Not relaxed, like after a massage. Calm, like a body that has finally learned it's safe.

The chronic insomnia that had required medication for years—I had just slept. Really slept. Without Zopiclone, without any sleep aid. My body remembered how to rest.

I know this sounds impossible.

I know it sounds like exaggeration, like wishful thinking, like the temporary euphoria that any powerful experience can produce.

I thought that too, at first.

But the freedom persisted.

Days passed. Weeks. Months.

The freedom remained.

## Not Temporary Relief

I had experienced relief before.

After good therapy sessions. After particularly powerful twelve-step meetings. After medications kicked in. After periods of sobriety when things seemed to be improving.

All of those reliefs were temporary.

They were like pumping water out of a sinking boat. Necessary work, but the boat was still sinking. The leaks were still there. No matter how much water you pump, you're always bailing.

This was different.

This wasn't pumping water.

This was sealing the leaks.

The covenants that had created the holes in my soul had been burned. The wounds that had kept me taking on water had been healed. The boat was no longer sinking because the boat was no longer damaged.

I could stop bailing.

I could just sail.

## The New Normal

In the days that followed the flood dose, I discovered what life felt like without the weight.

I woke in the morning without dread. Just... woke. Opened my eyes. Saw the day ahead. Not a burden to survive, but a gift to receive.

I ate food and tasted it. Sounds strange, but depression numbs everything—including the simple pleasure of flavor. For the first time in years, eating was enjoyable.

I talked to the staff at the clinic and felt present. Not performing presence. Not managing the conversation. Actually there, actually engaged, actually interested.

I called Nancy. When I heard her voice, something inside me opened instead of closing. The wall that had always stood between us—I couldn't find it.

"How are you?" she asked, her voice careful. Hopeful but guarded. She had learned not to trust good news.

"Nancy..." I couldn't get more out for a moment. "I'm free. I don't know how else to say it. I'm free."

She started crying.

"I believe you," she whispered. "I can hear it. Something's different."

---

## The Evidence

In the months following the ceremony, the evidence accumulated.

**Sleep.** For the first time in over a decade, I was sleeping naturally. Seven to eight hours, without medication. My body had remembered what it was supposed to do.

**Mood.** The depression did not return. Not the day after. Not the week after. Not the month after. The baseline of my emotional life had shifted. Not to mania or artificial happiness—to peace. Stable, sustainable peace.

**Relationships.** Nancy saw the change first. Then my children. Then friends and family. I was present in a way I had never been. I could receive affection. I could give it without agenda.

**Craving.** The obsessive desire for substances—the constant background noise of addiction that had driven relapse after relapse—silent. Not fought, not white-knuckled. Simply absent.

**Purpose.** The frantic striving that had characterized my whole life—the "Just watch me" fuel that had built empires—replaced by something calmer. Purpose without desperation. Direction without drivenness. Calling without compulsion.

## The Scriptural Reality

As I integrated the experience, certain Scriptures came alive in ways they never had before.

*"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."* — 2 Corinthians 3:17

I had read this verse hundreds of times. Now I understood it. Not as doctrine, but as experience. The Spirit had come, and freedom had come with Him.

*"So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."* — John 8:36

Free indeed. Not theoretically free. Not positionally free. *Indeed* free. Actually, experientially, measurably free.

*"It is finished."* — John 19:30

The words that had opened the flood dose were now my ongoing reality. The work Christ did on the cross was sufficient. The victory was already won. I wasn't fighting toward freedom—I was living from freedom.

---

## The Warning

Let me be clear about something.

I am not suggesting that ibogaine is the path to freedom for everyone.

I am not saying that what happened to me will happen to you if you do the same protocol.

I am not promoting a substance or a clinic or a method.

What I am saying is this: genuine healing is possible.

The chains that have bound you—however they were forged, however long you've worn them—can break.

The covenants that govern your life without your conscious consent—they can burn.

The freedom you may have stopped believing in—it exists. It's real. It's available.

Your path to that freedom may look nothing like mine. It may be prayer alone. It may be therapy. It may be some combination I cannot imagine.

But don't give up on freedom.

It is not a fantasy.

I am living proof.

## The Beginning

The flood dose was not the end of my journey.

It was, in many ways, the true beginning.

The covenants were burned, but the integration was just starting. The wounds were healed at the root, but new patterns had to be built. The freedom was real, but learning to live as a free man would take time.

The boosters that followed would seal the work.

The return to Transcend ninety days later would take me even deeper.

The integration process would become the ongoing project of my life.

But on that day, waking in a clinic in Cancun, with one word on my lips—

**Freedom.**

I knew that everything had changed.

The old Nicholas had died on that table.

A new creation had emerged.

Not through my effort.

Through surrender.

Through the blood of Jesus.

Through sacred medicine that God created.

**It is finished.**

**And it is begun.**

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you are still in chains, hear this:*

*Freedom is possible.*

*Not just survival. Not just management. Not just better coping.*

*Actual freedom.*

*The darkness you've known does not have to define you.*

*The covenants you've made do not have to govern you.*

*The weight you've carried can be lifted.*

*I do not know your path. I cannot prescribe your medicine. I cannot tell you how your freedom will come.*

*But I can tell you that it can come.*

*Because I have tasted it.*

*And it is real.*

*Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.*

*Hold on to that word.*

*Let it become your prayer.*

*Let it become your expectation.*

*Let it become your reality.*

*The garden is real.*

*The way exists.*

*And freedom waits.*
