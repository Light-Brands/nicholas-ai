# Chapter Six
## Vision: The Abuser

---

*"Facing Sadek After Thirty-Five Years"*

---

I was taken back.

Not in memory. Not in imagination.

*Taken back.*

To my childhood. To the basement. To the place where everything fractured.

And there he was.

Sadek.

---

## The Return

For thirty-five years, I had run from this memory.

I had acknowledged the abuse—in therapy, in recovery rooms, in moments of painful honesty with Nancy. I had named it, understood its effects intellectually, traced the ways it had shaped my covenants.

But I had never truly faced it.

Every time the memory approached, I deflected. Changed the subject. Built walls. Found ways to minimize, rationalize, keep the full weight of it at bay.

In the flood dose, there was no deflection possible.

The medicine carried me back, and I had no choice but to be there.

In the basement.

With him.

Eight years old again.

---

## Feeling What the Child Felt

This was the most painful part of the entire experience.

Not the other visions. Not facing my father or my children.

This.

Because I had to feel what that eight-year-old felt.

The confusion. Not understanding what was happening. Not having categories for this experience. The body responding in ways the mind couldn't comprehend.

The shame. The belief—universal among abuse survivors—that this was somehow my fault. That I had done something to cause it. That I was dirty, broken, wrong.

The fear. Not just of the acts themselves, but of being found out. Of what would happen if anyone knew. Of the world ending if this secret escaped.

The isolation. Having to carry this alone. No words for it. No safe person to tell. The loneliness of a child bearing an adult-sized trauma in a child-sized soul.

I felt all of it. In real time. The full weight of what that little boy experienced, no longer buffered by decades of avoidance.

I wept.

Not adult tears—the tears of an eight-year-old. The sobbing of a child who has been broken and doesn't know how to put himself back together.

---

## Seeing Sadek

And then I saw him.

Not as a monster. Not as the demon I had made him in my mind.

As a teenage boy.

Because that's what he was.

I had forgotten this—or refused to remember it. Sadek was not an adult. He was fourteen, maybe fifteen. A child himself, in many ways. A child who was almost certainly acting out something that had been done to him.

This did not excuse what he did.

But it reframed it.

He was not pure evil. He was a damaged boy, damaging another boy, in a chain of damage that stretched back further than either of us could see.

The abuse was wrong. The effects were devastating. The wound was real.

But the person who inflicted it was also wounded.

---

## The First Covenant Exposed

In that vision, I saw the moment the first covenant was made.

Not as an intellectual understanding—as a lived experience.

The little boy, overwhelmed by what was happening, made an unconscious agreement:

*Love equals suffering.*

*Intimacy leads to violation.*

*If you let anyone close, this is what happens.*

I watched the covenant form. Watched it write itself into my soul. Watched it begin shaping everything that would follow—the inability to be truly intimate, the walls around my heart, the performance of love without the vulnerability of love.

Thirty-five years of relationship dysfunction traced back to this moment.

One covenant, made in terror, governing decades.

---

## The Choice

And then I was given a choice.

Not by the medicine—by something deeper. By the God who was present throughout.

*You can stay here. You can remain defined by this wound. You can continue letting this boy's actions shape your entire existence.*

*Or you can forgive.*

I resisted.

Forgive? After what he did? After the decades of consequences? After the covenants and the walls and the inability to love freely?

*Forgive him?*

The voice was gentle but firm:

*The forgiveness is not for him. He may never know you forgive him. He may be dead by now. The forgiveness is not about him at all.*

*The forgiveness is for you.*

*The chains that bind you to that basement—the unforgiveness is what keeps them locked. The anger, the resentment, the hatred—these are the chains.*

*Forgiveness is the key.*

---

## The Forgiveness

I did not want to forgive.

Every part of me that had carried this wound for thirty-five years screamed against it. He didn't deserve forgiveness. He hadn't asked for it. He would never know, never change, never make amends.

But I understood.

Forgiveness was not saying what he did was okay.

Forgiveness was not pretending it didn't happen.

Forgiveness was releasing my need for him to pay. Releasing my attachment to the anger. Releasing the chains that kept me tied to that basement.

Forgiveness was freedom.

So I spoke. In that room in Cancun, lying on a bed, deep in visionary experience, I spoke out loud:

"I forgive you."

Simple words. Enormous weight.

"I forgive you for what you did to me. I forgive you for taking my innocence. I forgive you for the decades of consequence I didn't deserve."

And then, the harder part:

"I release you. I release you from being the center of my wound. I release you from having power over my present. I release you from the prison of my hatred."

---

## The Chains Break

What happened next was physical.

Something in my body released. Something that had been gripped tight for thirty-five years—in my muscles, in my nervous system, in the cellular memory of my body.

It let go.

I gasped. Actually gasped. The medical team noted my physical state shifting—heart rate, breath pattern, muscle tension all changing at once.

The chains that had bound me to that basement.

They were breaking.

Not because Sadek did anything.

Not because what happened was suddenly okay.

But because I had released my attachment to the wound.

I was no longer defined by it.

I was no longer imprisoned by it.

I was free.

---

## The First Covenant Burns

And with the release, the first covenant began to burn.

*Love equals suffering.*

For thirty-five years, this lie had governed my relationships. It had kept me from true intimacy with Nancy. It had built walls between me and my children. It had made love something to be feared rather than received.

Now it was exposed.

Now it was being consumed.

I watched it burn—not with my physical eyes, but with some inner vision that was more real than sight. The covenant, written on my soul at age eight, catching fire. The ink dissolving. The contract becoming ash.

*Love does not equal suffering.*

*Intimacy does not lead to violation.*

*What happened to you was wrong—but it is not the truth about love.*

New truth was being written in its place.

Truth about a God who is love.

Truth about a love that heals rather than wounds.

Truth about intimacy that is safe—that can be safe—when built on foundation instead of performance.

## For Survivors

Dear Traveler,

If you carry this wound—if abuse is part of your story—I need to speak directly to you.

What happened to you was not your fault.

The shame you carry belongs to your abuser, not to you.

The covenant you made—whatever form it took—was a survival mechanism, not a life sentence.

And forgiveness, if and when you're ready for it, is not about letting your abuser off the hook.

It's about letting yourself off the hook.

You have carried this long enough.

The chains can break.

The covenant can burn.

Freedom is possible.

I know because I found it. In a room in Mexico, thirty-five years after the wound was inflicted, I finally faced what I had been running from.

And I discovered: it no longer had power over me.

Not because I'm stronger.

Because grace is stronger than any wound.

---

*Sadek's face faded.*

*The basement dissolved.*

*I was no longer eight years old.*

*I was forty-five. Lying in a clinic. Being remade.*

*One covenant burned.*

*One more remained.*

*And the deepest vision was still to come.*
