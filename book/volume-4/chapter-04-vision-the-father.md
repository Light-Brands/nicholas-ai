# Chapter Four
## Vision: The Father

---

*"His Face Passed Through Me"*

---

My father's face appeared before me.

Not as a memory. Not as an image recalled from photograph albums.

As a presence. Real. Immediate. Filling my field of vision.

And then—impossible to describe but undeniably experienced—his face passed *through* me.

---

## The Weight of the Relationship

In that moment of passing through, I felt everything.

The love. My father loved me. This was not in question—had never been in question. From my earliest memories, his love was present. Fierce. Protective. Wanting the best for his son.

But also: the pressure. The expectation that I would achieve. That I would represent the family well. That I would become something.

And: the ultimatum. The moment when, faced with my addiction, he had drawn a line. The line that felt like abandonment even though it was meant as tough love. The line that became the fuel for my third covenant: *Just watch me.*

All of it, compressed into a single moment. The complexity of a father-son relationship, with all its wounds and blessings, presented to me in its entirety.

## Seeing Him Clearly

What the medicine showed me was unexpected.

I had come prepared to confront my father. To process the ways I felt he had failed me. To work through the pain of feeling judged, pressured, ultimately rejected.

But that's not what happened.

Instead, I saw him as a man.

Not as my father—as a man.

A man with his own wounds. His own fears. His own covenants made in his own moments of pain.

I saw how he carried the weight of providing for a family. The pressure of wanting his children to succeed in a world he knew was harsh. The fear of watching his son slide into destruction without the power to stop it.

I saw the ultimatum differently. Not as abandonment, but as the desperate act of a father who had tried everything else. Who loved me enough to risk losing me. Who drew a line because he didn't know what else to do.

He wasn't the source of my wound.

He was a wounded man himself.

## The Inheritance of Pain

The medicine showed me something else: the generational pattern.

My father's wounds had shaped his fathering.

His father's wounds had shaped his.

And so on, back through generations I couldn't see.

Each father passing down not just genetics but patterns. Ways of relating. Ways of protecting. Ways of wounding without meaning to.

I saw how I had received that inheritance. And I saw how I was passing it down to my own children—the distance, the difficulty with emotional intimacy, the tendency to hide behind achievement.

The pattern was visible. A chain stretching back through time, each link forged in pain, each link passing the pain forward.

And I understood: this is what needed to break.

Not the love—the love was real. But the pattern. The unconscious transmission of wounds from father to son.

If I didn't break it, Maverick would carry it.

And his son after him.

---

## The Forgiveness

What rose in me was not what I expected.

I had prepared anger. I had prepared confrontation. I had carried grievances about my father for years—the ways he failed, the pressure he applied, the ultimatum that felt like betrayal.

But in that vision, holding the complexity of who he actually was, something else arose.

Forgiveness.

Not the cheap forgiveness that denies the wound.

Real forgiveness. The kind that fully acknowledges the pain while simultaneously releasing the person who caused it.

I spoke out loud—the medical team later told me I was speaking throughout the experience, though I barely remember saying anything.

"I forgive you. I forgive you for the pressure. I forgive you for the ultimatum. I forgive you for not knowing how to love me in ways I could receive."

And more than forgiveness: release.

"I release you from being the source of my wound. You were not responsible for what I became. You did what you knew how to do. I release you."

---

## The Covenant Burns

And then I felt it.

The third covenant—*Just watch me*—beginning to loosen.

That covenant had been made in reaction to my father. The vow to prove myself, to achieve so dramatically that he would have to acknowledge my worth. The fuel that had driven my empire-building, my success-seeking, my relentless striving.

In forgiving him, I was no longer fighting him.

In releasing him, I was no longer trying to prove anything to him.

The covenant had nothing to grip. Its power was in the relationship wound—and the wound was being healed.

I felt chains falling.

Not metaphorically—physically. Something released in my body. My shoulders dropped. My chest opened. A weight I had carried for thirty years lifted.

*Just watch me.*

No longer necessary.

Because I was no longer performing for his approval.

I was simply being.

---

## The Blessing

The vision didn't end with forgiveness.

Something else happened.

My father's face, which had passed through me, now turned toward me.

And I received his blessing.

Not words—at least not words I remember. But something deeper than words. An energetic transmission. An approval that was not earned but given. A father's delight in his son, stripped of all conditions.

The blessing I had spent my life striving for—the blessing I had built empires to prove I deserved—it was simply given.

Not because of what I had achieved.

Because of who I was.

His son.

Loved.

Accepted.

Blessed.

---

## What This Means

I am not suggesting that my father was perfect.

I am not minimizing the real wounds that existed in our relationship.

I am saying that healing came through a shift in seeing.

When I stopped seeing my father as the enemy to be defeated, the judge to be appeased, the source of my wounding—and started seeing him as a fellow wounded human, doing his best with what he had—the dynamic changed.

Forgiveness became possible.

Release became possible.

And blessing—real blessing, not earned but received—became possible.

## The Lesson for Travelers

Dear Traveler,

Many of us carry father wounds.

The absent father. The critical father. The demanding father. The abusive father. The addicted father. The father who loved us but couldn't show it in ways we could receive.

These wounds are real. The pain they caused is valid. We do not need to minimize them.

But as long as we make our fathers the enemy—as long as we define ourselves in reaction to them—we remain imprisoned.

*Just watch me* only has power while someone is watching.

When we release them, we release ourselves.

When we forgive them, we stop carrying their failures.

When we see them as wounded humans rather than all-powerful figures, we reclaim our own power to become something different.

Your father's face may need to pass through you.

His wounds may need to be seen and grieved.

His failures may need to be forgiven and released.

And his blessing—the blessing you may have sought your whole life—may be waiting to be received.

Not earned.

Received.

*The vision faded.*

*But something had changed in me.*

*One covenant was burning.*

*Two remained.*

*The surgery was not finished.*
