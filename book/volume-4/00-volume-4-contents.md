### Volume Summary

This volume documents the most sacred twenty-four to forty-eight hours of Nicholas's life. After years of darkness, crisis, and exhausted options, he travels to Transcend Clinic in Cancun, Mexico, for an ibogaine ceremony.

What follows is not hallucination but revelation. Not escape but encounter. Not self-help but divine surgery.

The visions—of his father, his children, his abuser, his wife—expose and heal wounds that talk therapy could never reach. And in the culminating moment before God's throne, the three covenants that had governed Nicholas's life for forty-five years are finally, irrevocably burned.

He wakes with one word on his lips: Freedom.
