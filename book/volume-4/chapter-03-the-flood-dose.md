# Chapter Three
## The Flood Dose

---

*"24-48 Hours in the Surgery of the Divine"*

---

What follows is my attempt to describe what cannot fully be described.

The flood dose—the primary ibogaine experience—lasted between twenty-four and forty-eight hours. During that time, I was simultaneously in a room in Cancun and somewhere else entirely. A place beyond physical coordinates. A place where time operates differently. A place where the architecture of the soul becomes visible.

I will do my best to translate that experience into words. But know that the words are shadows of the reality. The map is not the territory. What happened in that room transcended language.

---

## The Nature of the Medicine

Ibogaine works differently than any other substance I have experienced.

It is not euphoric. There is no high, no escape, no pleasant dissociation from reality. If anything, it is the opposite—a forced confrontation with reality at depths the conscious mind usually protects us from.

It is not hallucinatory in the recreational sense. The visions that came were not random images or fantasy projections. They were memories. They were symbolic representations of psychological truths. They were encounters that felt more real than ordinary waking life.

And it was not passive. The medicine is not a pill you swallow and then sit back and watch. It is a dialogue. A collaboration. A surgery in which you are both patient and participant.

The medical team had told me to surrender. But surrender, I discovered, is an active process. I had to keep choosing to let go. Keep choosing not to resist. Keep choosing to face what emerged rather than shrink from it.

The medicine would show me. The choice to receive what it showed was mine.

## The Waves

The experience came in waves.

The first wave was the most intense—a rushing sensation, a feeling of being pulled deeper into myself. Memories began surfacing. Not in chronological order, not organized by any logic I could discern. Just arising, one after another, demanding attention.

The abuse.

The heartbreak.

The leaving home.

The drugs.

The empire.

The collapse.

All of it. Every moment I had buried. Every feeling I had refused to feel. Every truth I had avoided seeing.

It was overwhelming. At times, I thought I might break apart. The weight of forty-five years of unprocessed experience pressing down at once.

But always, beneath the overwhelm, those words: *It is finished.*

As if to say: *Yes, it's heavy. Yes, it's painful. But I am with you. And the outcome is already secured.*

---

## The Presence

I was not alone in that room.

The medical team was physically present—monitoring my vitals, offering water, checking on me periodically. I was aware of them dimly, like you're aware of nurses during surgery.

But there was another presence. One the medical equipment couldn't measure.

God.

I know this will be controversial to write. I know skeptics will attribute everything to neurochemistry, to activated brain regions, to the pharmacology of the alkaloid. And perhaps they're partially right—God can work through neurochemistry.

But what I experienced was not merely chemical. It was personal. It was relational. It was an encounter with the Divine as real as any conversation I've had with a human being.

More real, actually.

Because there was no pretense possible. No masks. No performance. I was laid bare, and I was met. Not with judgment—with love. Not with condemnation—with invitation.

*You are mine. You have always been mine. Even when you ran. Even when you hid. Even when you crowned yourself god. You were still mine.*

---

## The Timeline Collapses

In ordinary consciousness, time flows linearly. Past, present, future—a sequence we move through one moment at a time.

In the flood dose, time collapsed.

I was eight years old, experiencing the abuse again—but now with adult awareness, with the presence of God, with the ability to grieve what the child couldn't grieve.

I was fifteen, heart shattering, making covenants I didn't understand—but now seeing those covenants for what they were, seeing how they had shaped everything that followed.

I was sixteen, standing at the door of my childhood home, saying "Just watch me"—but now understanding the wound beneath the defiance, the fear beneath the bravado.

I was twenty-one, building empires, doing cocaine, performing success—and I could see how hollow it all was, how desperately I was running, how much the little boy inside was screaming for attention I couldn't give.

All of it happening at once. All of it interconnected. The timeline of my life visible as a single tapestry, each thread affecting all the others.

---

## The Surgery Begins

Somewhere in the depths of the experience, I understood what was happening.

Surgery.

The medicine was cutting. Opening places that had been sealed shut for decades. Exposing infection that had been festering in darkness. Draining wounds that conventional treatment could not reach.

It hurt.

Not physically—though my body went through waves of sensation. But emotionally, spiritually—the pain of facing what I had spent my life avoiding was immense.

The abuse. Not just the memory of it, but the full weight of what it had cost me. The innocence lost. The trust shattered. The belief that formed: *love equals suffering.*

I sobbed. I couldn't have stopped if I wanted to. Decades of unfelt grief pouring out of me like blood from an opened wound.

The heartbreak. Not just the loss of a teenage love, but the way I had responded—closing my heart, crowning myself god, vowing never to be vulnerable again.

More grief. More tears. The armor I had worn for thirty years dissolving in the flood.

The covenants. Not as abstract concepts now, but as living agreements. I could see them written on my soul like contracts. *Love equals suffering. I am my own god. Just watch me.* Each one a chain. Each one a prison I had built for myself.

---

## The Question

In the midst of the surgery, a question formed.

Not a question I asked—a question I was asked.

*Do you want to be free?*

Simple. Direct. The same question Jesus asked the man by the pool of Bethesda. *Do you want to be made well?*

It seems like an obvious question. Of course I want to be free. Of course I want to be well.

But in that moment, I understood why the question was necessary.

Part of me had become attached to my bondage.

The covenants were prisons, yes. But they were also protections. *Love equals suffering* kept me from the vulnerability that love requires. *I am my own god* kept me from the surrender that transformation demands. *Just watch me* kept me striving, achieving, running—avoiding the stillness where I would have to face myself.

To be free meant giving up the protections.

To be healed meant facing the pain I had built my whole life to avoid.

*Do you want to be free?*

I answered out loud, in that room in Cancun, tears streaming down my face:

"Yes. God, yes. Whatever it costs. I want to be free."

## The Knife Goes Deeper

After my answer, the medicine went deeper.

Images became more intense. Memories more vivid. The surgery more precise.

I saw the web of lies I had lived. Not just the obvious lies—the hidden ones. The ways I had deceived myself. The narratives I had constructed to avoid responsibility, to avoid feeling, to avoid truth.

I saw the people I had hurt. Nancy, carrying the weight of my dysfunction for twenty years. My children, sensing something wrong with their father even when I hid it. My parents, watching their son destroy himself while they prayed helplessly.

The pain of seeing clearly was almost unbearable.

But always, beneath it: *It is finished.*

Not: *It is excused.* Not: *It doesn't matter.* But: *The price has been paid. The victory is secure. What you see can be healed.*

I kept surrendering. Kept letting the medicine work. Kept saying yes to whatever it showed me.

And then, the visions began.

## What Visions Are

Before I describe the specific visions that came, let me be clear about what I believe they were.

They were not hallucinations—random images produced by a drugged brain.

They were not fantasies—projections of what I wanted to see.

They were revelations. Information delivered in symbolic, experiential form. Truth my conscious mind couldn't access, presented in a way my soul could receive.

The medicine didn't create the content of the visions. It opened the door to content that was already there—stored in my body, hidden in my memory, waiting to be faced and healed.

In the chapters that follow, I will describe each major vision in detail.

My father. My children. My abuser. My wife. My grandmothers.

And finally, the throne room itself.

These encounters constitute the sacred heart of my transformation. They are what the flood dose was building toward. They are the reason I can now say, with complete certainty:

I am free.

*Dear Traveler,*

*The surgery you need may not look like mine.*

*It may not involve medicine at all. It may happen in a therapy room, in a prayer meeting, in a moment of quiet surrender that no one else witnesses.*

*But whatever form it takes, genuine healing requires this: willingness to be opened.*

*Willingness to let the surgeon cut.*

*Willingness to see what you've avoided seeing, feel what you've avoided feeling, face what you've avoided facing.*

*This is terrifying. I know. The pain of opening is real.*

*But the alternative—staying closed, staying protected, staying imprisoned in covenants you made when you were too young to understand—that's worse.*

*The surgery hurts.*

*But the wound that heals is better than the wound that festers.*

*Trust the surgeon.*

*Let the knife do its work.*
