# Chapter Eight
## Before the Throne

---

*"Covenants Burned in Heavenly Fire"*

---

And then I was taken somewhere else.

Not to a memory. Not to a relationship. Not to any place that existed in the physical world.

I was taken before the Throne.

---

## The Ascent

I cannot describe how I got there.

One moment I was processing the visions—my father, my children, my abuser, Nancy's eye. The flood dose was still working through me, my body lying on a bed in Cancun while my consciousness journeyed elsewhere.

And then: a shift.

A sense of rising. Not physically—but spiritually. Dimensionally.

As if I was being lifted out of one realm and into another.

The visions of earth faded.

Something else emerged.

---

## The Holy of Holies

I do not have adequate language for what I saw.

The prophets who wrote Scripture—Isaiah, Ezekiel, John in Revelation—they struggled with the same limitation. Words built for earthly experience pressed into service for heavenly reality.

I will try.

There was light. Not light like sunlight or lamplight. Living light. Light that had personality, presence, intention. Light that communicated without words.

There was sound. Not music exactly, though music was part of it. A harmonic vibration that seemed to undergird everything. The sound of reality itself.

And there was presence.

Three presences. Distinct yet unified. Overwhelming yet welcoming.

Father. Son. Spirit.

The Godhead.

The Trinity.

I was before the Throne.

---

## Falling

I could not stand.

Whatever was carrying me through this experience, whatever consciousness I retained—it could not remain upright in this presence.

I fell.

Face down. Completely prostrate.

Not out of religious obligation. Not because I knew I was supposed to.

Because I could not do otherwise.

The holiness was too immense.

The love was too overwhelming.

The reality was too real.

I lay prostrate before God, and everything I had ever thought I knew about Him was revealed as shadow.

This was the substance.

---

## The Covenants Presented

And then I saw them.

The three covenants.

Not as concepts or memories—as objects. Documents. Contracts written on something that resembled parchment but was not parchment. Soul-material, perhaps. Whatever substance contracts are written on when they are written on the soul.

They were presented before me. Before the Throne.

**Covenant 1: Love Equals Suffering**

I saw the words. I saw the date—not a calendar date, but a moment-marker. Age eight. Basement. Terror crystallizing into agreement.

**Covenant 2: I Am My Own God**

The words glowed with defiance. Age fifteen. Heart broken. Trust shattered. The vow to need no one, trust no one, bow to no one.

**Covenant 3: Just Watch Me**

Ambition encoded as promise. Age sixteen. The door of my childhood home. The determination to prove worth through achievement.

Three contracts. Forty-five years of service. Governing my life without my conscious consent.

And now, laid bare before the Throne of God.

---

## The Renunciation

I understood what was being asked.

Not demanded—invited. God does not coerce. Even here, even in this overwhelming presence, the choice was mine.

*Renounce them.*

*Release them.*

*Let them burn.*

And so I spoke.

Not in my physical voice—though the medical team later told me I was speaking, crying out in that room in Cancun. But with something deeper than vocal cords. With the voice of my spirit speaking to the Spirit of God.

**"I renounce the covenant that love equals suffering."**

*I reject the lie that was written on my soul in that basement. I reject the belief that intimacy leads to violation. I reject the protection that became a prison.*

*I receive divine love that heals, not wounds. I receive the truth that perfect love casts out fear.*

**"I renounce the covenant that I am my own god."**

*I reject the throne I built for myself. I reject the crown I wore in the absence of trust. I reject the sovereignty that was always illusory.*

*I declare Jesus Christ as the Lord of my life. Not in word only—in reality. I surrender the throne. I yield the crown. He is Lord.*

**"I renounce the covenant 'Just watch me.'"**

*I reject the agreement with Mammon. I reject the need to prove my worth through achievement. I reject the performance that substituted for presence.*

*I receive Kingdom identity—not through doing, but through being. I am a son of the Father. That is enough. That has always been enough.*

Each renunciation was a ripping.

Something being torn from my soul that had been grafted there for decades.

It hurt.

But it was the pain of surgery, not injury.

The pain of healing.

---

## The Burning

And then they burned.

I watched the three covenants—the contracts that had governed my existence—catch fire.

Not ordinary fire. Heavenly fire. Fire that consumes what should not exist without destroying what should.

*Love equals suffering.*

The parchment blackened. The words disappeared. The covenant became ash.

*I am my own god.*

The defiance that had fueled so much striving—I watched it ignite, watched it consumed, watched it reduced to nothing.

*Just watch me.*

The ambition that had built empires and destroyed my soul—burning, burning, burning.

Gone.

All of it.

Forty-five years of invisible governance, consumed in holy fire before the Throne of God.

---

## The Blood

As the covenants burned, I became aware of something else.

Blood.

Not gruesome—sacred. The blood of Jesus, which I had heard about in church my whole life, was present in this vision. Present in a way that transcended metaphor.

The blood was washing what the fire exposed.

The covenants had left wounds when they were removed. Like removing tumors leaves surgical wounds. Something had to heal those places where the contracts had been embedded.

The blood was healing.

*By His stripes I am healed.*

Not just physical healing—though my body would be transformed. Soul healing. Spiritual healing. The wounds left by forty-five years of false covenants, cleansed and closed by blood that was sufficient for every sin, every wound, every contract ever written in darkness.

---

## The New Identity

As the old burned, something new was written.

Not covenants—declarations. Truth that replaced lies.

**I am the son of I Am.**

Not an orphan striving for acceptance. A son, born of the Father, carrying His nature, bearing His name.

**I am a king in the Kingdom of God.**

Not self-appointed sovereignty—delegated authority. A king who rules by serving, who leads by loving, who conquers by surrendering.

**I am a citizen of heaven.**

This world is not my home. Its systems are not my identity. Its measures of success are not my measure. I belong somewhere else—and I carry that somewhere else within me.

**I am an ambassador of God's Kingdom on earth.**

Sent, not striving. Assigned, not grasping. My purpose is not to build my own kingdom but to represent His.

**I am an apostle in the marketplace.**

Sent into the world of business, achievement, and success—but as a missionary, not a mercenary. Bringing Kingdom values into earthly systems.

**I am a healer in the marketplace.**

My wounds, once healed, become doors. My pain, transformed, becomes medicine. I carry healing for others who carry what I carried.

**Bringing the lost travelers back home to Papa.**

This is the mission. This is why I was saved. Not for myself—for others. The garden is real. The way exists. And I now know the way.

## The Return

I don't know how long I was before the Throne.

Time operates differently there. It could have been moments or hours. The medical team's records show a certain duration, but that measures physical time, not spiritual time.

Eventually, I began to descend.

Not falling—lowering. Being gently returned to the realm where my body waited.

The presence of the Trinity faded—not disappeared, but became less overwhelming. More like background than foreground. Always there, but no longer all-consuming.

I became aware of the bed. The monitors. The soft sounds of the medical team moving around me.

I was back.

But I was not the same.

---

## What Remained

The covenants were gone.

I could feel their absence. For forty-five years, they had been operating in the background of my consciousness—invisible software running every decision, shaping every relationship, driving every striving.

Now: silence.

Not emptiness—peace. The silence of a machine that has finally stopped running. The peace of a prisoner who has finally been released.

I lay on that bed and breathed.

Just breathed.

For the first time in my life, breathing was enough.

Being was enough.

I was enough.

Not because of what I had achieved or would achieve.

Because of whose I was.

---

*Before the Throne, everything changed.*

*The covenants burned.*

*The blood washed.*

*New identity was declared.*

*I was no longer the man who walked into that clinic.*

*I was being remade.*

*And one word was waiting to meet me when I woke.*
