# Chapter Five
## Vision: The Children

---

*"The Generational Curse Stops Here"*

---

After my father's face faded, two other faces emerged.

Maverick. Perla.

My children.

The ones who had inherited more than my genetics.

The ones who stood to inherit my wounds—or my healing.

---

## Maverick

My son's face appeared before me.

And then, like my father's face had done, it passed through me.

In that passing, I felt the connection between us. The invisible cord that links father and son. The transmission of patterns—conscious and unconscious—that flows through that cord.

I saw what I had been passing down.

The distance. The difficulty with emotional presence. The walls that protected me but isolated those who loved me.

I saw Maverick sensing something wrong with his father but not having language for it. Watching me retreat behind work, behind achievement, behind walls he couldn't penetrate. Learning that this is what men do. That fathers are present but not really present. That love is expressed through provision rather than presence.

The pain of seeing this was enormous.

I had not wanted to repeat my father's patterns. I had sworn I would be different.

But I wasn't different.

I was the same.

Different circumstances, different methods—but the same pattern. Father distant from son. Love real but unexpressed. The wound passing forward.

---

## The Promise

But then something shifted in the vision.

A voice—the same voice that had said "It is finished"—spoke again.

*You are not passing down pain. You are passing down promise.*

I didn't understand at first. How could I pass down promise when I had been passing down the same patterns that wounded me?

The voice continued:

*The curse stops here. Not because you were perfect—you weren't. But because you are choosing to heal. What you heal in yourself, you heal in your lineage.*

I understood.

The generational pattern was like a river. It had flowed through my father to me, and it was flowing through me toward Maverick.

But I was being healed.

And the healing was changing the water.

What would reach Maverick would be different than what had reached me. Not because I would suddenly become the perfect father—that wasn't possible. But because I would become a healed father. One who had faced his wounds. One who had broken the covenants. One who could offer presence instead of performance.

*The generational curse stops here.*

In my body. In my healing.

Maverick would not carry what I had carried.

He would carry something different.

Promise instead of pain.

## Perla

Then my daughter appeared.

But her vision was different.

She did not pass through me. Instead, she fell into my arms, crying.

I held her. Even in the vision—even lying on a bed in a clinic in Mexico—I physically felt my arms wrapping around her. The medical team told me later that I was making holding motions, speaking soothing words.

In the vision, I felt her tears on my shoulder. And I understood something.

She could feel me.

She had always been able to feel me.

My daughter's sensitivity was not weakness—it was a gift. She had been attuned to the emotional reality of our household in ways that words couldn't capture. She had felt my pain even when I hid it. She had sensed the walls even when I denied they existed.

And she had carried that.

Not because I had wanted her to.

Because empaths absorb. Because sensitive children feel what parents try to hide. Because the walls that protect us from vulnerability do not protect those who love us from our pain.

---

## The Reconciliation

But the vision showed me something else.

Her crying was not accusation. It was reconciliation.

She was showing me: *I felt it all. I carried it with you. And I'm still here.*

This was not condemnation—it was connection.

All those years I had hidden, believing I was protecting her. All those years I had performed wellness, thinking that was what she needed.

She had known.

And she had loved me anyway.

In the vision, I spoke to her:

"I'm sorry. I'm sorry I couldn't be present. I'm sorry you felt what I was trying to hide. I'm sorry I wasn't the father you deserved."

And she looked at me—this vision-daughter, this soul-representation—and said something that broke me:

"You're here now. That's what matters."

---

## The Safety

The voice spoke again:

*Because you have faced your pain, she is safe.*

I understood.

As long as I was hiding, she was in danger. Not physical danger—emotional danger. The danger of absorbing wounds she didn't understand. The danger of inheriting patterns through osmosis rather than genetics.

But now I was facing my pain.

Now I was healing.

And that changed everything for her.

She didn't need me to have been perfect.

She needed me to be healing.

She needed to see that facing wounds was possible. That the darkness was not final. That her father—broken, flawed, hospitalized, relapsed—could still become whole.

That would be her inheritance.

Not perfection.

Transformation.

---

## The Connection Restored

In the vision, something shifted between us.

The wall I had always felt—the barrier that kept me from fully reaching her—dissolved.

Not because I tore it down with effort.

Because the healing was removing what had built it.

The wall was made of shame. Of fear. Of the need to protect her from what I was. But as the covenants burned, as the wounds were being healed, the raw material of the wall disappeared.

For the first time—even in vision—I could simply hold my daughter without anything between us.

No performance.

No protection.

Just presence.

And she received it. Her tears shifted. The grief mixed with something else.

Relief.

Relief that her father was finally becoming available.

## What I Learned About Children

Dear Traveler,

If you have children, hear this:

They feel what you hide.

The walls you build to protect yourself do not protect them. They absorb anyway—they just absorb confusion along with the pain.

And the wounds you carry, you pass down. Not through words or explicit teaching. Through the invisible transmission that happens in households. Through the air. Through the nervous system resonance that children experience before they have words.

But here is the hope:

The healing you do is not just for you.

Every wound you face, you face for them.

Every covenant you break, you break in their future.

Every chain that falls from you loosens on their wrists.

You cannot give your children a perfect childhood. None of us can.

But you can give them a healing parent.

And that—watching transformation happen in someone they love—may be the most powerful inheritance of all.

*Maverick and Perla.*

*My children.*

*No longer recipients of my curse.*

*Now witnesses to my healing.*

*The lineage was changing.*

*In my body, the chain was breaking.*

*What came after me would be different than what came before.*
