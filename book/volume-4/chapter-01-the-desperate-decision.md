# Chapter One
## The Desperate Decision

---

*"When You've Tried Everything, You Become Willing to Try Anything"*

---

The decision to undergo ibogaine treatment was not made lightly.

It was made desperately.

And desperation, I would learn, was the gift that opened the door.

---

## The Stories That Kept Coming

Throughout my darkest season, stories kept finding me.

Not the kind of stories I was looking for. Not the conventional recovery narratives I already knew—the twelve-step testimonies, the medication management success stories, the therapy breakthroughs that happened gradually over years.

Different stories.

Stories of people who had been where I was. Hospitalized. Medicated. Suicidal. People who had tried everything—and I mean genuinely *everything*—within the conventional framework. Who had reached the same wall I was hitting.

And who had found healing in a matter of days that years of treatment couldn't provide.

Through something called ibogaine.

---

## Initial Resistance

My first reaction was dismissal.

*Plant medicine? That sounds like something from the counterculture, not from legitimate healing.*

*Psychedelics? Isn't that just another form of drug use—the very thing I'm trying to escape?*

*Mexico? Underground clinics? This sounds dangerous, unproven, possibly even demonic.*

I had all the objections that you, dear reader, may have right now. The skepticism that comes from a lifetime in conventional systems. The fear that comes from desperation's dark cousin—false hope.

I dismissed the stories. I focused on what I knew. I continued with the medications, the therapy, the hospitalizations.

And I continued to deteriorate.

---

## The Research Begins

Something kept pulling me back to those stories.

Not my own will—I wanted to dismiss them. But something else. The same quiet voice that had told me "There is more. This is not the end."

So I began to research. Quietly. Almost ashamed of my curiosity.

What I found surprised me.

Ibogaine was not some new-age invention. It came from the iboga shrub, native to Central Africa. It had been used for centuries in traditional spiritual practices—the Bwiti tradition, where it was considered sacred medicine for accessing deeper truth.

In the modern era, it had gained attention for its remarkable effects on addiction and trauma. Not as a recreational drug, but as a therapeutic intervention. One that appeared to work at levels that conventional treatments couldn't reach.

The research was limited—ibogaine remained illegal in the United States, which restricted formal study. But the testimonials were overwhelming. And they weren't coming from fringe communities. They were coming from therapists. From doctors. From people with advanced degrees and decades in traditional medicine who had seen too much to ignore.

---

## The Mechanism

What I learned about *how* ibogaine worked fascinated me.

It wasn't about getting high. It wasn't about escape or euphoria.

Ibogaine appeared to work by resetting certain neural pathways—particularly those involved in addiction and trauma. It created a window of neuroplasticity, allowing the brain to form new connections. It accessed stored memories and unprocessed trauma that the conscious mind had buried.

But more than that—and this was what the scientific literature couldn't fully explain—ibogaine facilitated visionary experiences. Profound encounters that many described as spiritual. Encounters with deceased relatives. With aspects of their own psyche. With something they could only call God.

The clinical explanations made sense to my mind.

But the spiritual testimonies spoke to my soul.

---

## Paul's Perspective

I brought my research to Paul.

He had experience with clients who had done plant medicine work. He wasn't an evangelist for it, but he wasn't opposed either.

"Ibogaine is not magic," he told me. "It's a tool. What matters is what you do with what it reveals."

He explained that the medicine could access trauma stored in places that talk therapy couldn't reach. It could surface memories and wounds that the conscious mind had hidden for protection. It could create breakthrough experiences in hours that might take years of conventional work—or might never happen at all through conventional means.

But he also warned me: "The medicine will show you everything. The light and the shadow. You have to be prepared to face what comes up. And you have to do the integration work afterward. The ceremony is just the beginning."

His balanced perspective gave me confidence. He wasn't selling me on ibogaine. He was acknowledging it as a legitimate option for someone in my position—someone who had tried everything else.

---

## The Spiritual Question

As a person of faith, I had to wrestle with the spiritual dimension.

*Is this medicine from God? Or is it opening doors that shouldn't be opened?*

*Am I trusting God by considering this? Or am I abandoning my faith for something dangerous?*

I prayed. For weeks, I prayed.

And what I received, gradually, was a shifting of my assumptions.

God created the iboga plant. God embedded its molecular properties. God placed it in the hands of people for centuries who used it in sacred contexts.

Who was I to say that God couldn't use this medicine for healing?

The counterargument came too: *The devil can disguise himself as an angel of light. Just because something produces experiences doesn't mean those experiences are from God.*

This was valid. I held both possibilities.

But what I kept returning to was this: I was dying. Not metaphorically—literally dying. The suicidal ideation was constant. The medications weren't working. The therapy was helpful but not sufficient. The hospitalizations were not healing me, only warehousing me.

If there was a possibility of genuine healing—even an unconventional one—didn't I have an obligation to explore it?

Didn't God sometimes work through unexpected channels?

## Nancy's Fear

I talked to Nancy.

Her reaction was what I expected: fear. Deep, legitimate fear.

"What if something goes wrong? What if you have a bad reaction? What if this makes things worse instead of better?"

All valid concerns. Ibogaine carried medical risks—particularly for people with certain heart conditions. The experience itself could be intense, overwhelming, potentially traumatic if not properly supported.

"And what if it's just another false hope?" she added, her voice breaking. "What if you go there and nothing changes and you come back even more devastated?"

This was the fear beneath the fear. Not just that something might go wrong—but that even this wouldn't work. That I truly was unfixable. That this last option would fail like all the others.

I took her hands.

"I have tried everything else. I believe God is leading me to this. I don't know what will happen. But I know I can't keep going like this. I have to try."

She cried. I held her. And eventually, she nodded.

"Then go. I'll be here praying. Whatever happens, I'll be here."

## The Clinic

I chose Transcend Clinic in Cancun, Mexico.

There were many options—clinics in Costa Rica, Jamaica, other locations where ibogaine treatment was legal. I researched them all.

Transcend stood out for several reasons. Their medical protocols. Their integration support. Their respect for the spiritual dimension of the experience without imposing any particular religious framework.

I made contact. I answered their extensive health questionnaires. I underwent the required medical screenings to ensure my heart could handle the medicine.

The process itself was healing. After years of being treated as a patient, a diagnosis, a problem to be managed—here was a team treating me as a person pursuing transformation. Not managing my symptoms, but preparing me for breakthrough.

The date was set. August 2025.

I would fly to Cancun in the darkest season of my life.

And I would come home either transformed or dead to the old self.

Either way, the running would stop.

---

## The Preparation

The weeks before departure became a kind of sacred preparation.

I tapered off certain medications under medical supervision—some could interact dangerously with ibogaine. I adjusted my diet. I followed the clinic's protocols precisely.

But more than the physical preparation, I prepared spiritually.

I spent hours in prayer. Not the desperate, pleading prayers of my crisis moments—something different. Surrendered prayers. Prayers of release.

*Lord, I don't know what's going to happen. I don't know if this is the path you've designed for me or a detour I'm taking out of desperation. All I know is that I cannot continue as I am.*

*I surrender the outcome. I surrender my assumptions about how healing should come. I surrender my need to understand before I obey.*

*If this medicine is from you, let it do your work. If it's not, protect me.*

*Either way, I trust you. Even when I can't feel you. Even when the darkness is complete.*

*I trust you.*

---

## The Letters

I wrote letters. Just in case.

To Nancy: Everything I wanted her to know about what she meant to me. How her faith had kept me alive. How I was sorry for the pain I had caused. How I believed better days were coming—for her, if not for us together.

To Perla: My daughter, whose sensitivity had always felt like a mirror to my own hidden wounds. I told her she was seen. That her depths were a gift, not a curse. That I loved her beyond my ability to express.

To Maverick: My son, whose life I had sometimes watched from behind walls I couldn't breach. I told him I was proud of him. That I saw his strength. That whatever happened, he should know his father loved him—even when his father couldn't show it.

Writing these letters broke something open in me.

The possibility that I might not return. The possibility that these might be my final words.

It clarified everything.

If I died in that clinic—from a medical complication, from facing more than my heart could handle—at least I would have said what needed to be said. At least the people I loved would know.

And if I lived, I would live having stared death in the face and chosen transformation anyway.

---

## The Faith of Desperation

Looking back, I understand something about the decision.

It wasn't faith in ibogaine. I didn't know if the medicine would work.

It wasn't faith in Transcend Clinic. I didn't know if their protocols were sufficient.

It was faith in the God who had sustained me through everything else.

Faith that said: *I don't see the path. I can barely take the next step. But I believe you're leading me somewhere, even through this unconventional door.*

Desperation is an underrated spiritual virtue.

When you've tried everything, when all your strength has failed, when your best efforts have produced nothing but continued bondage—desperation strips away pride. It removes the illusion that you can save yourself. It creates the emptiness that only God can fill.

My desperation was not weakness.

It was the doorway to transformation.

---

## The Day of Departure

The morning I left for Mexico, I stood in our bedroom with Nancy.

Neither of us knew what would happen.

Both of us were terrified.

I held her face in my hands and looked into her eyes—the same eyes that had seen through me twenty years before, that had never stopped believing in who I could become.

"I love you. Whatever happens, I love you."

She kissed me. Tears on both our faces.

"Come back to me. Come back whole."

I walked out the door.

I drove to the airport.

I boarded a plane to Cancun.

And I flew toward the most sacred encounter of my life.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*If you are considering unconventional paths to healing, I understand the fear.*

*The questions you're asking are the right questions. Is this safe? Is this legitimate? Is this from God?*

*I can't answer those questions for you. Your path may not involve plant medicine at all. It may be something else entirely—something you can't yet imagine.*

*But I can tell you this: desperation is not shameful. Reaching the end of conventional options is not failure. Being willing to try something new when everything familiar has failed is not foolishness—it's courage.*

*The decision to pursue healing, even through doors that scare you, is an act of faith.*

*Trust the glimmer.*

*Follow where it leads.*

*The garden may be closer than you think.*
