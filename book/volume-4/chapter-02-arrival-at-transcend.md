# Chapter Two
## Arrival at Transcend

---

*"The Darkest Season Meets the Brightest Possibility"*

---

The plane descended over Cancun, and I watched the Caribbean blue stretch toward the horizon.

It was beautiful. Painfully, almost mockingly beautiful.

Because inside me, everything was gray.

---

## The Man Who Arrived

Let me be precise about who arrived at Transcend Clinic that August day.

I was experiencing active suicidal ideation. Not vague thoughts about death—specific, persistent whispers telling me my family would be better off without me.

I was dependent on Zopiclone for sleep. Had been for years. Without it, I might sleep two or three hours—sometimes not at all.

I was carrying chronic insomnia, unresolved trauma, depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. My nervous system was so dysregulated that baseline existence felt like survival mode.

I had lost hope in conventional treatment. Not because it was worthless—it had kept me alive—but because it couldn't reach what needed to be healed.

I was, in the most literal sense, ready to die.

Ready to die physically if that's what the medicine brought.

Ready to die spiritually—to the old self, the old patterns, the old covenants.

I had nothing left to protect. Nothing left to hide.

The breakdown had been so complete that I arrived with nothing but surrender.

## First Impressions

A driver met me at the airport.

The ride to the clinic was quiet. I watched the tourist areas of Cancun give way to quieter neighborhoods. The transition felt symbolic—leaving the surface glitter of regular life for something deeper, more serious.

Transcend Clinic was not what I expected.

Not a sterile medical facility. Not an ayahuasca retreat center with tapestries and incense.

It was a villa. Comfortable, private, designed for the work that would happen there. Every detail communicated intention—the calming colors, the natural light, the quiet spaces for reflection.

I was greeted by the medical team. A doctor. A nurse. A therapist who would support my integration.

Their warmth was genuine but not excessive. They understood that people didn't come here for vacation. They came because everything else had failed.

---

## The Medical Assessment

Before any treatment could begin, there was extensive medical screening.

EKG to assess my heart function. Ibogaine affects cardiac rhythms, and certain conditions make treatment dangerous. Blood pressure. Heart rate. Complete medical history reviewed again, now in person.

The doctor was thorough. Professional. But also compassionate.

"We've reviewed everything you sent us. Based on your screening, we believe you're a good candidate for the treatment. But I want to be clear about the process."

He explained what would happen. The flood dose—the primary ibogaine experience—would last anywhere from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The medicine would come in waves. The initial phase would be the most intense—visionary experiences, memory processing, emotional surfacing.

"Your job is to surrender," he said. "Don't try to control what you see. Don't try to interpret it in the moment. Just let the medicine work."

He explained the risks. Cardiac events were rare but possible. Difficult psychological experiences could emerge—suppressed memories, intense emotions, confrontation with shadow aspects of the psyche.

"We'll be monitoring you the entire time. But ultimately, the medicine will take you where you need to go. Our job is to keep you safe while it does its work."

I signed the consent forms. Not casually—I read every word. But I signed.

I was past the point of turning back.

## The Preparation Room

They showed me to the room where the ceremony would take place.

A bed. Medical monitoring equipment. Soft lighting. A window looking out at tropical greenery.

This would be my sacred space. The operating room where God would perform surgery.

I sat on the bed and breathed.

The fear was there. Underneath the surrender, fear still lurked—fear of what I might see, what I might feel, what might emerge from the depths I had kept locked for so long.

But stronger than the fear was a strange peace.

Whatever was coming, it was better than where I had been.

---

## The Final Night

The flood dose was scheduled for the following morning. That night, I was alone with my thoughts.

I called Nancy. Her voice broke when she heard mine.

"I'm here. I'm safe. It starts tomorrow."

"I've been praying all day. I won't stop."

I could hear the fear in her voice, but also something else. Faith. She believed something was possible—even when I could barely believe it myself.

"I love you," I said.

"I love you. Come home to me."

After we hung up, I tried to sleep. The Zopiclone was out of my system—I had been tapering for weeks. Sleep came fitfully, in fragments.

But that was okay.

I wasn't there to sleep.

I was there to wake up.

---

## The Morning

The morning of the flood dose, I woke with the sun.

No appetite for breakfast, though the team encouraged me to eat something light. Orange juice. Toast. My body felt electric, humming with anticipation and fear.

The therapist came to talk with me.

"Is there anything specific you want to work on? Any intentions for the experience?"

I thought about her question.

"I want to be free. Whatever that means, however that looks—I want to be free from the chains I've been carrying."

She nodded. "Good. Hold that intention loosely. The medicine may take you somewhere you don't expect. Trust the process."

I understood. This wasn't about controlling the outcome. It was about surrendering to whatever needed to happen.

The doctor came in. The nurse prepared the IV line for saline, which would keep me hydrated through the experience.

"Are you ready?"

Was I ready?

I had been preparing for this moment for months. Years. Maybe my whole life.

"Yes."

---

## The Threshold

They gave me the ibogaine capsule. Small. Unassuming.

Such a small thing to carry such transformation.

I swallowed it with water.

"The effects typically begin within forty-five minutes to an hour," the doctor explained. "When you start to feel it, lie back. Let it come."

I sat in silence. The team moved quietly around me, checking monitors, adjusting lights. They knew this dance. They had witnessed this threshold many times.

I closed my eyes.

In the darkness behind my eyelids, I prayed.

*Lord, I don't know what's coming. I surrender this experience to you. Whatever needs to be healed, heal it. Whatever needs to be revealed, reveal it. Whatever needs to die, let it die.*

*I trust you.*

*Even here. Even now.*

*I trust you.*

---

## The First Stirring

Somewhere around the forty-five minute mark, I felt it.

Not dramatic at first. A subtle shift in perception. Colors seemed more vivid. Sounds more layered.

Then deeper. A heaviness in my body. A loosening of something I couldn't name.

"I feel it starting," I said.

"Good. Lie back. Let it come."

I lay back on the bed. Closed my eyes again.

The room began to recede.

Not physically—I knew I was still in that room, on that bed, with the medical team watching. But something was happening inside me that transcended physical space.

A door was opening.

A door I had kept locked for forty-five years.

And what came through it would change everything.

---

## The Flood Begins

The medicine came like water breaking through a dam.

Not a trickle. A flood.

Suddenly, I was no longer in Cancun. I was no longer Nicholas the patient, the addict, the failed businessman, the hospitalized mental patient.

I was something else. Someone else. Being carried by a current I couldn't control and didn't want to.

Images began flooding my consciousness. Memories. Faces. Moments from my past that I had buried, avoided, refused to face.

But they weren't attacking me. They were presenting themselves. As if to say: *Look. See. It's safe now. You can look.*

And then I heard it.

Clear. Unmistakable. A voice that was not my own.

**"It is finished."**

---

## The Words That Changed Everything

"It is finished."

The same words Jesus spoke on the cross.

In that moment, something collapsed in me. Not a bad collapse—a relief. A letting go. A surrender so complete that tears began streaming down my face.

*It is finished.*

The battle I had been fighting for decades—the struggle to fix myself, to earn my healing, to achieve my way to wholeness—it was over.

Not because I had won through effort.

Because Christ had already won.

The shame. The guilt. The fear. The condemnation.

*Finished.*

Not diminished. Not managed. Not improved.

Finished.

I lay there weeping, the medicine carrying me deeper, the words reverberating through every cell of my body.

*It is finished.*

*It is finished.*

*It is finished.*

And the visions began.

---

*Dear Traveler,*

*There is a threshold. A point where preparation ends and surrender begins.*

*I cannot tell you what waits on the other side of your threshold. It may be terrifying. It may be beautiful. Most likely, it will be both.*

*But I can tell you this: the words "It is finished" are not just for me.*

*Whatever battle you've been fighting—whatever chains have bound you—the victory has already been won.*

*The cross was not just a historical event. It is an eternal transaction.*

*And when you finally surrender—really surrender, without reservation, without escape routes, without plans B and C—you may hear those words too.*

*It is finished.*

*Not because you finished it.*

*Because He did.*
