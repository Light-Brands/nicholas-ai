# Chapter Seven
## Vision: Nancy's Eye

---

*"Understanding the Sacred Contract"*

---

After the fathers, after the children, after the abuser—I expected Nancy.

She was, after all, the central relationship of my adult life. The woman who had seen through me from the beginning. The wife who had endured more than any spouse should endure. The prayer warrior whose faith had never wavered even when mine collapsed entirely.

I expected a vision of her.

What I received was something stranger. And more significant.

---

## The Single Eye

Nancy appeared only briefly.

Not her whole face. Not her body. Not a full encounter like the others.

Just her eye.

Her right eye, looking at me from a distance.

Looking deep into my soul.

I reached for her in the vision. I wanted to go deeper—to process our relationship the way I had processed my relationship with my father. To face the wounds I had caused her. To receive and offer forgiveness.

But I couldn't reach her.

She remained at a distance. Present but not accessible. Watching but not engaging.

And then the eye faded.

---

## The Confusion

In the moment, I was confused.

Why couldn't I go deeper with Nancy? Why was her vision so brief, so incomplete, when the others had been so immersive?

The medical team had told me to trust the process. That the medicine would take me where I needed to go. That what arose was what needed to arise, in the order it needed to arise.

But this felt incomplete.

I lay in the aftermath of the vision, wondering. Had I blocked her somehow? Was there resistance I wasn't aware of? Had I failed some aspect of the ceremony?

The answer came later. And it reframed everything.

---

## The Revelation

God spoke into my confusion.

Not audibly—but with that same clarity that had characterized the whole experience. Truth arriving in my consciousness as if planted there by an outside source.

*You first had to make peace with your own pain.*

*Only then could you feel hers.*

I understood.

The work of this flood dose was not about my relationship with Nancy. It was about my relationship with myself. With my wounds. With my covenants.

I could not truly meet Nancy—not at the depths she needed to be met—until I had faced what kept me from meeting her.

The walls I had built were not just protection from the world.

They were protection from her.

And I could not love her freely while those walls stood.

---

## The Sacred Contract

In the weeks and months following the ceremony, this revelation deepened.

Nancy and I have what I can only call a sacred contract.

From the moment she saw through the performer to the wounded man beneath, she was not just choosing a husband. She was choosing a mission. Her prayers, her faith, her endurance through years of crisis—these were not just wifely devotion. They were intercession. Spiritual warfare. A woman who knew that the man she married was not the man she was ultimately supposed to have.

She was loving me into awakening.

Not enabling—loving.

Not codependent—called.

The sacred contract was this: she would hold the vision of who I could become, even when I couldn't see it. She would pray me through the darkness, even when I cursed God and crowned myself. She would remain, even when leaving would have been justified.

Not because I deserved it.

Because God had joined us for this purpose.

---

## What I Could Not Yet See

The brief vision of Nancy's eye was a promise.

*There is more to come. But you're not ready yet.*

I had just begun the healing. The covenants were burning, but the integration was just starting. The walls were coming down, but I hadn't yet learned to live without them.

Nancy deserved more than a half-healed man trying to love her.

She deserved the man I was becoming.

And that man was not yet fully formed.

The eye watching from a distance was her patience. Her willingness to wait. Her faith that what God had started, He would finish.

I didn't need to rush into that relationship work.

I needed to continue the healing.

And when I was ready—when the walls were truly down, when the wounds were truly healed, when I could be present instead of performing—she would be there.

She had always been there.

---

## The Depth That Awaited

In subsequent ceremonies and in the months of integration that followed, I would go deeper with Nancy.

I would feel her pain for the first time.

Not intellectually—I had always known I hurt her. But *feel* it. In my body. The weight she had carried. The hope she had held. The years of watching her husband self-destruct while she prayed and waited and endured.

When that feeling came, I wept differently than I had wept before.

The tears for my own wounds were necessary. But the tears for her wounds were transformative.

Because they proved the walls were down.

Because you can only feel another person's pain when you're no longer protecting yourself from your own.

---

## The Marriage Renewed

I share this vision not as the climax of the Nancy story, but as the promise of what was coming.

After the flood dose. After the boosters. After months of integration. Something changed between us.

Not perfectly. Not magically. Marriage is still work, and we are still two imperfect people learning to love each other.

But different.

The distance that had always separated us—the glass wall I couldn't break through—it began to dissolve.

For the first time, I could be present with her.

For the first time, I could feel what she felt.

For the first time, our sacred contract could begin to fulfill its purpose.

Not just her loving me into awakening.

But both of us, awakened, loving each other—and loving others—into the garden.

## For Spouses

Dear Traveler,

If you love someone who is wounded—if you've been enduring, praying, holding space for someone in their darkness—I see you.

The sacred contract is real.

Some marriages are not just partnerships—they are callings. Assignments from God. Missions that require more than romance, more than compatibility, more than common interests.

If that's your marriage, don't give up.

The one you're loving through the darkness may not be able to meet you yet.

The walls may still be standing.

The wounds may still be unhealed.

The capacity for true intimacy may be beyond their current reach.

But healing is possible.

And when it comes—when the walls fall, when the wounds close, when the covenants burn—what awaits on the other side is worth everything it cost to get there.

Keep praying.

Keep holding space.

Keep watching with that single eye.

The one you love is being remade.

And when they emerge, they will finally be able to meet you.

*Nancy's eye faded from my vision.*

*But her presence remained.*

*She was praying for me. Even now. Even across the miles.*

*Her prayers were the wind in my sails.*

*And the journey was not finished.*

*The throne room awaited.*
