# Preface to Volume III: The Dark Night
## When Everything You Built Disappears (2018-2021)

---

Dear Traveler,

I have walked through the valley of the shadow of death.

Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Literally. There were nights in those years when I held the weight of ending my own life in my hands. When the darkness was so complete, so absolute, that I could not remember there had ever been light.

This is the volume I almost did not survive to write.

February 26, 2018. The day the towers fell. Seven point nine million dollars—gone. The title I had built my identity upon—gone. The team, the empire, the carefully constructed performance of my life—gone. And in the wreckage, something was revealed that I had spent decades hiding from myself.

I was never healed. I was only hiding.

What followed was eighteen months of crisis. Multiple hospitalizations. A diagnosis of Bipolar Type 2 that finally gave language to the chaos I had always felt. And then, the thing I thought could never happen: after eight years of sobriety, I drank again.

The shame of that relapse nearly killed me.

But here is what I know now that I could not see then: *my relapses were not failures. They were initiations.*

I do not say this to excuse the drinking or to minimize the destruction it caused. I say it because it is true. Every time I fell, I fell further into the darkness—and the darkness, I would eventually learn, was not my enemy. The darkness was the crucible. The darkness was the furnace. The darkness was where the covenants that had ruled my life would finally be exposed.

*Love equals suffering. I am my own god. Just watch me.*

These were the three agreements I had made in the silence of my wounded soul. Agreements I never consciously chose. Agreements that had governed every relationship, every achievement, every desperate reach for control. And they could only be seen in the dark night.

My therapist Paul became my guide during this season. He introduced me to the framework of Actor versus Director—the split between the performing self and the authentic self that had defined my entire existence. He helped me understand that my childhood abuse had fractured me into pieces, and that those pieces had each developed survival strategies that were now destroying me.

Identity annihilation is the prerequisite for identity resurrection.

This is the sacred truth of Volume Three. And it is terrifying. Because before you can become who you truly are, you must first lose who you thought you were. The false self must die. The towers must fall. The carefully constructed identity must be dismantled stone by stone until nothing remains but the naked soul before God.

I would not wish the dark night on anyone. But I would not trade it for anything.

Because it was there, in the absolute darkness, that I finally stopped running. It was there that I finally admitted I could not save myself. It was there that the foundation for real transformation was laid—not by my effort, but by my surrender.

If you are in the dark night now, dear traveler, I need you to hear me: *You are not alone. The darkness is not your enemy. And this is not the end.*

I know you cannot see the garden from where you stand. I know the path forward is invisible. I know the weight of your suffering feels unbearable.

But the dawn is coming. And you are being prepared for something you cannot yet imagine.

Hold on.

With love from one who survived,
