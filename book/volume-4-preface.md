# Preface to Volume IV: The Sacred Encounter
## Ibogaine and the Burning of Covenants (August 2025)

---

Dear Traveler,

Some surgeries require medicine that only the Divine can administer.

I did not come to this conclusion easily. For years, I held suspicion toward anything that existed outside the conventional frameworks of recovery I had been taught. Twelve steps. Therapy. Medication. These were the approved pathways, the sanctioned roads to healing. Anything else felt dangerous, illegitimate, perhaps even sinful.

But I had walked those approved roads for nearly two decades. And while they kept me alive—and I am eternally grateful that they did—they could not reach the depths where my wounds lived. They could not touch the covenants buried in the basement of my soul.

In August of 2025, I traveled to Cancun, Mexico. To a clinic called Transcend. And there, over twenty-four to forty-eight hours, I underwent something that I can only describe as sacred surgery.

Ibogaine.

The first words I heard when the medicine began its work were these: *"It is finished."*

What followed was not a hallucination. It was not an escape from reality. It was the most real experience of my entire life. I encountered my father—and forgiveness flowed both ways. I saw my children, Perla and Maverick—and understood that the generational curse that had plagued my lineage was being stopped in my body. I faced my abuser—and the chains that had bound me for decades finally broke.

And then I stood before the Throne.

There, in the presence of something holy and terrible and beautiful beyond description, I watched the three covenants that had ruled my life consumed by heavenly fire. *Love equals suffering*—burned. *I am my own god*—burned. *Just watch me*—burned. The invisible agreements I had never consciously made but had faithfully kept for forty-five years were finally, irrevocably, destroyed.

I woke with three words on my lips: *Freedom. Freedom. Freedom.*

This volume is not a promotion of sacred medicine. I am not here to tell you that ibogaine or any other plant medicine is the path you should walk. That is between you and God. What I am here to tell you is that some wounds exist in places that talk therapy cannot reach. Some covenants are written in a language that twelve steps cannot read. Some surgeries require a medicine that the rational mind cannot comprehend.

I share my encounter with full awareness that it will be controversial. That some who have walked with me thus far will stumble at this threshold. That the religious will call it demonic. That the scientific will call it delusion. That the gatekeepers of conventional recovery will shake their heads and warn others away.

Let them.

I know what happened in that room. I know what was broken. I know what was healed. And I know that I walked out of that clinic a different man than the one who walked in—not through my own effort, not through white-knuckling my way to transformation, but through an encounter with the Divine that I could never have manufactured or earned.

If you are reading this, dear traveler, and something in you resonates—if you have done all the right things and still carry wounds that will not heal—I want you to know that there may be a sacred encounter waiting for you. It may not look like mine. It may not involve medicine at all. But the God who created you knows exactly what surgery you need.

The garden is closer than you think.

And sometimes, the door appears in the most unexpected places.

With love and holy reverence,
