# Preface to Volume II: The Resurrection Attempt
## Eight Years of Sobriety, One Unchanged Soul (2007-2018)

---

Dear Traveler,

I got sober.

For eight years, I did not drink. I attended meetings. I worked the steps. I found a sponsor. I became a sponsor. I checked every box the recovery world told me to check, and I did it with the same excellence I had once applied to building nightclubs and businesses.

And I remained unchanged.

This is the hardest truth of my journey to share, because it implicates the very systems that saved my life. AA gave me a framework. Rehab gave me distance from the bottle. My sponsor gave me accountability. These things were necessary. I am grateful for them. Without them, I would not be alive to write these words.

But recovery without transformation is reformation without resurrection.

You can rearrange the furniture in a burning house. You can paint the walls and hang new curtains. You can convince yourself and everyone else that the house is fine, that the work is done, that you are healed. But if the fire still burns in the basement, if the foundation is still fractured, if the covenants still operate in darkness—the house will fall.

In 2008, I married Nancy. She became my wife, my partner, my anchor. In the years that followed, we were blessed with Perla and Maverick—two souls I love more than language can hold. I became VP of Sales at Ideal Protein, accumulating $7.9 million in stock options. I built The Ideal Way coaching empire. I was the picture of redemption, the poster child for recovery.

And I was performing the entire time.

*Actor versus Director.*

My therapist Paul would later name this split. But during those eight years, I didn't have the language. I only knew that something was wrong, that somewhere behind the performance of sobriety was a soul still bound by invisible chains. The covenant that said *love equals suffering* was still running. The covenant that whispered *you are your own god* was still operating. The defiant vow of *just watch me* still drove every achievement.

I was sober. But I was not free.

This volume is for everyone who has done the work and still feels empty. For the recovered ones who have never truly healed. For the ones who checked every box, followed every program, said all the right things—and woke up one morning to discover they were still the same person, just drier.

I am not here to condemn the recovery industry or the twelve steps or the therapists and counselors who dedicate their lives to helping people like me. I am here to tell you that these tools, as valuable as they are, may not be enough. That sobriety is not the destination but the doorway. That the real work—the transformation of the soul, the breaking of covenants, the death of the false self—requires something more.

February 26, 2018, was the day my towers finally fell. The $7.9 million vanished. The title disappeared. The team I had built scattered. And I discovered, in the rubble, that I had never built anything real at all.

But that destruction is not the subject of this volume. That story belongs to Volume Three.

This volume is about the dangerous middle—the years when we think we are healed because we are managing, when we believe we are transformed because we are behaving, when we mistake the absence of crisis for the presence of wholeness.

If you find yourself there now, dear traveler, I see you. I was you. And I want you to know: the emptiness you feel is not evidence of your failure. It is the voice of your soul calling you deeper.

There is more. There is always more.

The garden is still waiting.

With love and hard-won humility,
